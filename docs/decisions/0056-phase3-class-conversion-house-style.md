# ADR-0056: How a class is converted in Phase 3: the C++ class, its Objective-C façade, and the checklist

- Status: Proposed. The default is in effect until Jon decides (CLAUDE.md rule 10).
- Date: 2026-09-29
- Bead: oo-11m (the `OOColor` house-style exemplar). Refines the per-file recipe of
  [Phase 3](../phases/3-cpp-conversion.md); builds on [ADR-0003](0003-intrusive-refcount.md),
  [ADR-0012](0012-c-stays-c.md), [ADR-0026](0026-oofnd-ref-semantics.md),
  [ADR-0029](0029-objc-floor-without-foundation.md), [ADR-0043](0043-foundation-sweep-recipe.md) and
  [ADR-0055](0055-foundation-endgame-boundaries.md).

## Context

The Phase 3 recipe maps each Objective-C construct to C++, but it does not say how a converted class
stays usable by the code that still messages it. Phase 3 converts leaves inward, so a leaf's callers
are, by construction, not converted yet. `OOColor` is typical: about 90 files name it (800 lines),
several of them giant files that other beads will convert slice by slice. Those callers:

- send it messages (`[OOColor redColor]`, `[c redComponent]`);
- keep `OOColor *` ivars with `retain`/`release`, or `oo::ObjCRef<OOColor *>` in containers;
- pass it through `id`: `PList::Object` nodes (`oo::PListObject(color)`), shader uniforms, and
  `isKindOfClass:[OOColor class]` checks.

None of that compiles against a C++ class. Fleet stories are sized at 8 files and 400 written lines,
and most leaves have more callers than that, so "convert the class and all its callers" cannot be the
rule. Two other questions were open: the seam table named `src/Core/OOColor.hpp/.cpp` while the phase
doc says files stay `.mm` until Phase 4, and nothing fixed naming, `const`, nil handling or where a
converted class's tests live.

Measured on this toolchain (clang 22, libobjc2, `-fobjc-runtime=gnustep-2.2`, probes in bead
oo-11m):

1. An Objective-C class `OOColor` and a C++ class `cxx::OOColor` coexist in one translation unit.
   Inside `namespace cxx` the unqualified name is the C++ class, and `[::OOColor class]` names the
   Objective-C one.
2. libobjc2's weak references (`objc_initWeak`, `objc_loadWeakRetained`) work on `OOObject`
   subclasses and read nil before `-dealloc` runs, so a table of weak peers never returns an object
   that is being deallocated.

## Decision (recommended defaults)

1. **Files keep their names: `X.h` and `X.mm`.** The C++ class is declared in `X.h` and defined in
   `X.mm`, which stays Objective-C++ (`.mm` becomes `.cpp` in Phase 4). The header's includers do not
   change. This supersedes the seam table's `OOColor.hpp/.cpp`.
2. **The class is `class X : public oo::RefCounted`** (or `: public Y` once `Y` is C++). Ivars become
   private data members with the same names, zero-initialised (`= {}`) as `class_createInstance`
   zeroed them. A private category becomes private member functions.
3. **Names and types are translated, not redesigned.**
   - The member name is the selector's first keyword: `colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha:` is
     `colorWithRed(r, g, b, a)`. Selectors that share a first keyword become overloads. Phase 2's
     `cxx_` prefix is dropped (ADR-0043 item 6), on free functions too when every caller is inside
     the bead (`cxx_OORGBAComponentsDescription` becomes `OORGBAComponentsDescription`).
   - A class method becomes `static`. A result that was `X *` (autoreleased) is `oo::Ref<X>` by
     value; a parameter that was `X *` is `X *` (borrowed). `BOOL` becomes `bool`.
     `[[X alloc] init]` becomes `oo::makeRef<X>()`, `[[self retain] autorelease]` becomes
     `oo::Ref<X>(this)`, `nil` becomes `nullptr`.
   - Types that Phase 2 already made C++ stay exactly as they are, including
     `std::optional<std::string>`; Phase 6 tidies them.
   - No `const` on member functions, except where a decision fixes the signature
     (`descriptionComponents() const`, ADR-0055 item 1). Const-correctness is Phase 6 work.
4. **Bodies stay verbatim except for the message syntax** (ADR-0012). `[self foo]` becomes `foo()`,
   and `[X foo]` inside `X` becomes `foo()`.
   - A message to an object that may be nil becomes a null-guarded call that does what nil did:
     nothing, 0, or `nullptr`.
   - An out-parameter that a nil message left unwritten is zero-initialised. It was indeterminate,
     and the analyser rejects the read.
   - `OOAssert`/`OOParameterAssert` become `OOCAssert`/`OOCParameterAssert`. There is no `self` or
     `_cmd` any more, so the failure text names the function.
   - A selector the class calls by name becomes an explicit table of its candidates, as the recipe's
     `NSSelectorFromString` row says. Exemplar: `kNamedColors`.
   - `-cxx_descriptionComponents` becomes `std::optional<std::string> descriptionComponents() const`.
5. **While anything outside the bead still messages the class, it keeps an Objective-C façade, and
   the C++ class is `cxx::X`.**
   - `X+ObjCBridge.h` holds the old `@interface`, copied exactly (same selectors, same types, same
     root). Its one ivar is `oo::Ref<cxx::X>`. `X+ObjCBridge.mm` forwards every method in one line.
   - Objective-C objects cross the boundary through two overloaded functions:
     `oo::ToObjC(cxx::X *)` gives an autoreleased façade, nil for null, and
     `oo::ToCxx(X *)` gives a borrowed pointer, null for nil.
   - `oo::ObjCPeers` (`oofnd/objc/OOObjCPeer.h`) keeps at most one live façade per C++ object and
     holds it weakly, so identity survives the crossing. That keeps `==`, `-isEqual:`, Object nodes,
     "returns itself" and "copy is retain" exact.
   - `X.h` imports the bridge header as its last line. `meson.build` lists `X+ObjCBridge.mm` after
     `X.mm`. Callers compile unchanged.
   - Converted code never messages the façade. It holds `oo::Ref<cxx::X>` and crosses with
     `ToObjC`/`ToCxx` when it calls unconverted code.
   - The C++ class is in `namespace cxx` because the Objective-C name is taken. The bridge's
     deletion bead moves the class to the global namespace and deletes `cxx::` at every use, one
     mechanical replacement. A class with no façade (every caller adapted in the bead) is global from
     the start.
6. **Every façade has a deletion bead,** filed when the façade is made. The bead's acceptance
   requires that the bridge files are gone and that no `cxx::X` is left. The Phase 3 exit gate
   (zero `@implementation`) cannot pass while any façade exists.
7. **A converted class has a unit test: `tests/unit/core/test_X.mm`.**
   - The test links the game's own objects for the class, its bridge and what they need: one entry
     in `tests/unit/core/meson.build`, extracted from the `oolite` target.
   - It runs with `bash tools/check-core-tests.sh`, which is `meson test --suite core` plus an
     inventory check.
   - It pins what the class computed before the conversion. Write the expectations against the
     Objective-C API, run them on the unconverted class, then port them.
   - It also covers the façade's contract: the same answers, nil stays nil, and identity.
8. **Gates for a conversion bead:**
   - `! grep -nE '@implementation|@interface|@selector|@protocol'` over `X.mm` and `X.h`;
   - `tools/build-windows.sh test` with no new warning;
   - `tools/tier-a.sh` on `X.mm` and on `X+ObjCBridge.mm` (`OOLITE_TIER_A_BUDGET=120`, as the
     Phase 2 recipe allows);
   - `bash tools/check-core-tests.sh`;
   - `bash tools/tier-c.sh --only goldens` (`2 blessed verified`);
   - `bash tools/guardrails.sh`.

## Consequences

- A leaf converts in one bead of about four files, whatever its fan-out. Its callers then convert in
  their own beads, in any order, and each one's façade crossings disappear as it converts. OOColor's
  bead touched 0 caller files.
- Each façade costs one forwarding method per selector, plus one weak-table lookup per crossing and
  per façade creation. It exists only until its deletion bead.
- `cxx::` appears in converted code for a while, and a later mechanical commit per class removes it.
  This is the Phase 2 `cxx_` idea again: scaffolding named so that it can be found and deleted.
- Identity is preserved at the crossing. Mutable classes are the ones where identity matters most:
  two façades for one object would break `==` and collection membership.
- After gnustep-base is unlinked (oo-qps.18), the core tests link libobjc2 alone with no change,
  because they use the game's own dependency list.

## Alternatives considered

- **Convert every caller in the same bead (a codemod).** 90 files for `OOColor`, including giant
  files other beads are slicing. It fails the sizing rule for most leaves, and the receiver's type
  cannot be known without semantic tooling.
- **The C++ class takes the name `OOColor` and the façade is renamed.** Every Objective-C caller
  would change at conversion time. That is the same fan-out as the codemod.
- **A new façade object per crossing, with no peer table.** Simpler, but a C++ object that crosses
  twice becomes two Objective-C objects. That breaks `==`, `-isEqual:`, `containsObject:` and
  "returns itself".
- **A back-pointer to the façade inside the C++ object.** It keeps Objective-C state inside the
  converted class, and every deletion bead would have to edit the class again. A side table keeps the
  class clean.
- **`X.hpp`/`X.cpp` now.** 90 includers change, and `.cpp` cannot hold the message sends that
  converted code still makes to unconverted classes. Phase 4 renames.
- **Tests under `tests/unit/oofnd`.** Game classes are not oofnd, and on phase-3 their headers still
  reach Foundation, which the oofnd objc tests forbid.

## Amendment (bead oo-o89): platform (SDL/) code, and a subclass of an Objective-C class

- Date: 2026-09-29. Status: Proposed, as above. Exemplar: `src/SDL/OOSDLJoystickManager.h/.mm`,
  `OOSDLJoystickManager+ObjCBridge.h/.mm`, `tests/unit/core/test_OOSDLJoystickManager.mm`.

**Context.** Of the `SDL/` files, `MyOpenGLView.mm` is being pre-split, `MyOpenGLView+Input.mm`
and `GameController+SDLFullScreen.mm` are categories of classes defined elsewhere, and `main.mm`
has no `@implementation` (rule 9: not a class conversion). The representative leaf is
`OOSDLJoystickManager`. Its superclass, `Core/OOJoystickManager`, is still Objective-C: it creates
its subclass by `Class` (`+setStickHandlerClass:`, `+sharedStickHandler`), messages its overrides
(`joystickCount`, `nameOfJoystick:`, `getAxisWithStick:axis:`), and keeps its own state (button,
axis and hat tables), which the subclass fills by calling the superclass's decoders. A C++ class
cannot derive from an Objective-C one, so item 5's thin façade does not fit as is.

**Decision (recommended defaults).**

1. **Platform code converts like Core code.** SDL and GL calls are C and stay verbatim (ADR-0012).
   SDL types (`SDL_Event *`, `SDL_Joystick *`, `SDL_JoystickID`) and the typedefs over them
   (`JoyAxisEvent`) are kept, as are `NSInteger`/`NSUInteger` in signatures (item 3: translated,
   not redesigned). The test is `tests/unit/core/test_X.mm` like any other. It initialises only the
   SDL subsystem it needs, with no window, and simulates the device (`SDL_AttachVirtualJoystick`)
   with the hardware drivers hinted off, so the machine's own devices cannot change the answers.
2. **A class whose superclass is still Objective-C** becomes `cxx::X : public oo::RefCounted`,
   holding only its own ivars and methods. `X+ObjCBridge.h` keeps the old `@interface` with the
   old superclass, and differs from item 5 in four ways:
   - **The façade makes and owns the C++ object** in its `-init`. The C++ constructor is the old
     `-init` body up to `[super init]`, and the façade calls `[super init]` after it. `-init`
     then records itself as the peer: `Peers().peerFor(cxx, [self] { return [self retain]; })`
     inside an `@autoreleasepool`.
   - **Overrides of superclass methods** are forwarded like any other method. The superclass's
     dynamic dispatch reaches the façade, and the façade reaches the C++ class.
   - **A message to `self` (or `super`) that the superclass implements** becomes
     `[oo::ToObjC(this) selector]`, because the superclass's state lives in the façade.
   - **`oo::ToObjC` gives the live façade or nil. It never makes a new one**, because a new
     façade would have fresh superclass state. Until the superclass converts, the C++ object is
     made only by its façade, and converted code does not `makeRef` it.
3. **The façade's deletion bead depends on the superclass's conversion bead.** When the
   superclass is C++, `cxx::X` derives from it (item 2), the forwarded overrides become `override`,
   `[oo::ToObjC(this) …]` becomes a plain call, and the bridge files go.
4. **A category file on a class that is not converted** (`GameController+SDLFullScreen.mm`,
   `MyOpenGLView+Input.mm`) is not a separate conversion. Its methods become members of `cxx::X`
   in the bead that converts `X` (or a slice of it). The members stay defined in the category's
   file, so no body moves. Until then, its bead is blocked on `X`'s.

**Consequences.** The subclass converts before its superclass, and its callers
(`MyOpenGLView.mm` registers the class, `MyOpenGLView+Input.mm` sends it `handleSDLEvent:`) stay
unchanged. The bead touched no caller. The cost is a façade that carries state, and so cannot be
deleted before the superclass converts. Converting the superclass first needs none of this and
is the better order when both are in reach. This amendment is the default when the leaf is
reached first.

## Amendment (bead oo-smy): a module's roots, global state, keeping objects, bitwise copies

- Date: 2026-09-30. Status: Proposed, as above. Exemplar: `src/Core/Materials/OOMaterial.h/.mm`
  and `OOMaterial+ObjCBridge.h/.mm`, `src/Core/OODrawable.h/.mm` and `OODrawable+ObjCBridge.h/.mm`,
  `tests/unit/core/test_OOMaterial.mm`, `tests/unit/core/test_OODrawable.mm`.

**Context.** Materials is a module of hierarchies: `OOMaterial` → `OOBasicMaterial` →
`OOSingleTextureMaterial`/`OOMultiTextureMaterial`/`OOShaderMaterial`, and `OODrawable` →
`OOMesh`/`OOPlanetDrawable`/`OOSkyDrawable`, about 22 beads. Both roots are abstract and compute
little, so each converts as Amendment 1 says: public virtual members, and a façade that is also the
base of the Objective-C subclasses, with an adapter as their C++ part. Three things Amendment 1 did
not meet: `OOMaterial` keeps global state (the current material, retained, and class methods over
it); some code *keeps* materials and drawables rather than calling them, and an adapter does not
retain its Objective-C owner, so a C++ reference alone lets the owner be deallocated; and `OOMesh`
copies itself bitwise, which copies the façade's reference to its C++ part.

**Decision (recommended defaults).**

1. **A module converts root first, one bead for its roots,** then each class after its
   superclass (Amendment 1 item 1). The subclass beads depend on the roots' bead, and on the bead
   of their direct superclass when that is not the root (`OOSingleTextureMaterial`,
   `OOMultiTextureMaterial` and `OOShaderMaterial` on `OOBasicMaterial`'s). A root's own
   per-file conversion bead is superseded by the module bead.
2. **Every method a subclass overrides is virtual, `-cxx_descriptionComponents` included:**
   `virtual std::optional<std::string> descriptionComponents() const`. A root that had no
   components answers `std::nullopt`, as `OOObject` did. The adapter forwards it to
   `-cxx_descriptionComponents`, and a C++ object's façade prints the C++ class's name with the
   components (Amendment 1 item 5). A default body whose parameter is unused leaves the name in a
   comment, `setBindingTarget(id<OOWeakReferenceSupport> /*target*/)`: that is the fix
   `misc-unused-parameters` offers, not a suppression.
3. **Class methods and file statics.** A class method is a `static` member, and the façade's class
   method forwards to it. A file-static object reference becomes a function returning a
   never-destroyed static (`ActiveMaterial()`, as `Peers()` is), because the old static was
   never released at exit. A root's `-dealloc` body (`[self willDealloc]`) stays in the façade's
   `-dealloc` for an Objective-C subclass instance, whose `-dealloc` it is. It has no C++
   destructor: it guards against being deallocated while current, which cannot happen to a C++
   object that the current-material slot retains. The analyser also rejects its virtual call
   (`unapplyWithNext`) during destruction, which would not reach the subclass anyway.
4. **Converted code that keeps an object of a hierarchy with Objective-C subclasses keeps the
   Objective-C object:** `oo::ObjCRef<::X *>(oo::ToObjC(p))`, and calls through
   `oo::ToCxx(ref.get())`. That object owns the whole of either kind: an Objective-C subclass
   instance owns its adapter, and a façade owns its C++ object. An `oo::Ref<cxx::X>` to an adapter
   keeps only the adapter, which answers as nil once its owner is gone. A borrowed `cxx::X *` for
   the length of a call is fine. The keeping code changes to `oo::Ref<X>` in the façade's deletion
   bead. Exemplar: the current material, which `test_OOMaterial.mm` checks stays alive whichever
   side made it current. This is an exception to step 7 of the phase checklist while the
   hierarchy has Objective-C subclasses. For the same reason a class that keeps materials or
   drawables (`OOMesh`, `OOEntityWithDrawable`) is better converted after the subclasses it keeps;
   when it converts first, it follows this item.
5. **A subclass that copies itself bitwise** (`OOMesh`'s `-mutableCopyWithZone:`, the
   `NSCopyObject` replacement) calls `oo::ConstructCxxPartOfCopy(copy)`, declared in the root's
   bridge, where it constructs its own C++ ivars afresh. The copy gets its own adapter, and the
   copied reference is dropped, not released. That one line is the only edit to a subclass's file.
6. **A body that messages `self` with a method of an unconverted category** (`-oo_objectSize`
   from `NSObjectOOExtensions`) sends it to `oo::ToObjC(this)` (amendment oo-o89, item 2). For an
   Objective-C subclass instance that is the instance itself, so the answer is unchanged.
7. **The test** follows Amendment 1 item 8 for each root. It also checks the global state across
   the crossing (a C++ material told an Objective-C one comes next, and the other way round),
   that the kept object stays alive, and the bitwise copy. A root's test links what the root's
   file needs (`OOVector.mm` and `legacy_random.c` for `kZeroBoundingBox`).

**Consequences.** Each root has one façade and one deletion bead. The deletion bead depends on
every subclass bead and on the beads of the classes that message or keep the root's objects. Until
then `ActiveMaterial()` holds an Objective-C object, and item 4's `ObjCRef` appears in converted
code that keeps materials or drawables. `OOMesh.mm` gained one line.
