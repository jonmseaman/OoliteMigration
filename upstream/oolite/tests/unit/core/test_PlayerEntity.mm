/*	test_PlayerEntity.mm
	Unit tests for PlayerEntity (src/Core/Entities/PlayerEntity.h), the player's ship: slice 1 of
	its slice plan (docs/phases/3-slices/PlayerEntity.md, bead oo-jx5np), the class shell, which
	moves the player's state into cxx::PlayerEntity and keeps the Objective-C PlayerEntity as its
	facade, a subclass of the ship's (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8, oo-60fwo and
	oo-jx5np).

	Like the ship's, the player's object needs the game graph, so the test links the whole game but
	main (['*']) and uses a Universe that was never initialised and an empty JavaScript context for
	the events the ship sends its scripts. The player is made in two steps, as the game makes it:
	-init (+sharedPlayer) early in start-up, before there is ship data, and -deferredInit once there
	is. Setting the player up from shipdata, the session and the controls (slice 5 and
	PlayerEntityControls) need the game's data, so a subclass stands in for those three and only
	counts; the cases test the slice's own units: +sharedPlayer, -init (the ship made the player's
	way, and the only player), -deferredInit (the ship's initialiser sent again over the same
	object, and the player's own defaults), and -dealloc (it releases what the player held, and a
	player released before its initialiser ran). The expectations were written against the
	Objective-C API and run on the unconverted class first. Ivars the test reads or sets go through
	the category below, the one place that knows where they live. The tests after those pin the
	crossing: an Objective-C player's C++ part is a cxx::PlayerEntity, and the facade's _cxxPlayer
	is that part.
