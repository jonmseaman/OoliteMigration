"""G8 - the scenario screen, entered from start-screen row 22 and left again by its row 1.

docs/phases/0-gui-tier.md G8: "Launch -> confirm row 22 -> confirm row 1 (``Return to Menu``) ->
verify start screen -> exit". The bug class is a GUI state machine that goes one way: a screen you
can enter and cannot leave is a wedged game, and it is exactly what a rewrite of the screen
dispatchers breaks without breaking anything that compiles.

Written the way the two merged tests closest to it are written, and reusing both wholesale:

* **G2** (test_g2_exit_via_keyboard.py) for ROW DERIVATION. No row number in this file's
  navigation is typed. ``scenario_screen_row()`` reads ``int row_zero = N;`` and the
  ``[gui selectedRow] == K+row_zero`` branch that calls ``-setGuiToScenarioScreen:`` out of
  ``-pollDemoControls`` (PlayerEntityControls.m), the same way G2 reads its ` Exit Game ` row; and
  the derivations are asserted to AGREE with the literals in the story, so a renumbered menu fails
  LOUDLY instead of quietly confirming the wrong row.
* **G5** (test_g5_screen_round_trips.py) for the INSTRUMENT. The observable is the game's own
  ``guiScreen``, read over the debug console - PlayerEntityLegacyScriptEngine.m:920 answers that
  property with ``OOStringFromGUIScreenID(gui_screen)``, a direct read of the instance variable
  each screen's setter assigns. The ScreenWitness client below, its marked-reply protocol (the
  console ECHOES the command text first, so a marker spelled literally in the command matches its
  own echo - it is split in the source and joined at runtime, and the answer is the text between
  the SECOND and third occurrence, hence ``count >= 2``) and the per-frame key sampling are G5's,
  restated here for the same reason G2 restated them: a shared helper added to conftest.py by two
  concurrent GUI beads is a guaranteed merge conflict, and nothing below is needed by any other
  test.

WHAT "ROW 1" ACTUALLY IS ON THE SCENARIO SCREEN. DERIVED, NOT ASSUMED.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The story says "confirm row 1 (``Return to Menu``)" and that is worth checking rather than
trusting, because the three screens G5 round-trips leave by three DIFFERENT mechanisms (a Space
key, a ``Back`` row, an ``_EXIT`` row). On this screen it IS a numbered, addressable row, and the
number is derived from the game's own source in ``scenario_exit_row()``:

    PlayerEntityLoadSave.m:207 -setGuiToScenarioScreen:
        OOGUIRow start_row = GUI_ROW_SCENARIOS_START;                     (PlayerEntity.h:164, = 3)
        [gui setArray:... DESC(@"oolite-scenario-exit") ... forRow:start_row - 2];
        [gui setKey:@"exit" forRow:start_row - 2];                        => row 1
        [gui setSelectableRange:NSMakeRange(start_row - 2, ...)];         => row 1 is selectable
        [gui setSelectedRow:start_row];                                   => but NOT preselected

    PlayerEntityLoadSave.m:314 -startScenario
        if ([key isEqualToString:@"exit"]) return NO;                     // "return to main menu"

    PlayerEntityControls.m:5064 case GUI_SCREEN_NEWGAME:
        if ([self checkKeyPress:n_key_gui_select] || [gameView isDown:gvMouseDoubleClick])
            if (![self startScenario]) { [UNIVERSE removeDemoShips]; [self setGuiToIntroFirstGo:YES]; }

So confirming row 1 makes ``-startScenario`` answer NO for the ``exit`` key, and the dispatcher's
NO branch is the ONLY thing on that screen that calls ``-setGuiToIntroFirstGo:YES``. Every link in
that chain is pinned by an offline guard below, and ``DESC(@"oolite-scenario-exit")`` is checked
against descriptions.plist to be the story's "Return to Menu" - so the row this test confirms is
the row the story names, and not merely row number 1.

Note what row 1 is NOT: it is not preselected. ``-setGuiToScenarioScreen:`` leaves the selection on
``start_row`` (3), the first scenario, so a bare Enter on arrival would START a scenario - i.e.
load a save game - rather than back out. This test therefore SELECTS row 1 before confirming it,
and never confirms any ``Scenario:N`` row.

THE ARRIVAL OBSERVABLE HAS TWO ASSIGNMENT SITES, AND THAT IS STATED RATHER THAN GLOSSED
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G5 could say each of its three screens' identifiers was assigned in exactly ONE place in the tree.
``GUI_SCREEN_NEWGAME`` is not like that - it is assigned TWICE, and pretending otherwise would be
the dishonesty this tier exists to prevent:

    PlayerEntityLoadSave.m:262  -setGuiToScenarioScreen:      the screen setter, what G8 wants
    PlayerEntityLoadSave.m:803  -loadPlayerFromFile:asNew:    ``if (asNew) gui_screen = GUI_SCREEN_NEWGAME;``

The second is still a sound witness for this test, for a reason that is CHECKED and not asserted
in prose: that assignment is immediately followed, in the same straight line of code, by
``[self setGuiToStatusScreen]`` (PlayerEntity.m:7924, ``gui_screen = GUI_SCREEN_STATUS``), so the
value cannot be OBSERVED from outside that method - by the time the run loop polls again,
guiScreen is GUI_SCREEN_STATUS. The only way to reach :803 at all is ``-startScenario`` selecting
a ``Scenario:N`` row, which this test never does. Both halves of that argument are pinned by
``test_the_arrival_observable_has_exactly_two_assignment_sites_and_only_one_is_observable``; if a
future edit gave the load path a lingering GUI_SCREEN_NEWGAME, that guard goes red and this
file's arrival claim is re-justified deliberately rather than silently weakened.

``GUI_SCREEN_INTRO1`` - the return observable - is assigned in exactly one place
(PlayerEntity.m:10070, ``-setGuiToIntroFirstGo:``), which is checked the same way.

ARRIVAL AND RETURN ARE SEPARATE PROPERTIES, WITH SEPARATE MESSAGES
------------------------------------------------------------------
The test asserts them as two assertions with two distinct, non-overlapping messages
(``ARRIVAL FAILED``/``RETURN FAILED``), because a single "the round trip worked" assertion cannot
say which half broke - and because one assertion wearing two names is the defect this fleet keeps
finding. They fail independently: breaking the entry gesture reddens ARRIVAL and never reaches
RETURN; breaking only the back-out gesture leaves ARRIVAL green and reddens RETURN. That
independence is what makes each one load-bearing, and it is required structurally by
``test_g8_asserts_arrival_and_return_as_separate_properties`` below, which reads this file's own
AST rather than its text.

This file reads no expansion content: nothing here opens an .oxp or .oxz, and the only rows it
ever confirms are the start screen's scenario row, the scenario screen's ``exit`` row and the
start screen's ` Exit Game ` row.
