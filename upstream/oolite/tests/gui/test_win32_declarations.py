"""Every Win32 call in this tier must declare argtypes/restype (bug oo-x2uy).

A ctypes foreign function with no ``argtypes`` marshals a Python ``int`` argument as a 32-bit
C ``int``; with no ``restype`` it decodes the return value as a 32-bit signed ``int``. On
64-bit Windows an HWND is a pointer-sized 64-bit handle, so an undeclared call cannot carry
one. Windows usually hands out small HWNDs, which is why the tier appeared to work - the bug
is LATENT, and a test that merely calls the functions on today's handles proves nothing.

So these tests prove two separate things, and neither needs a window:

* ``test_undeclared_call_cannot_carry_a_64_bit_handle`` demonstrates the defect itself against
  a real 64-bit ctypes function pointer: the undeclared call loses (or refuses) a handle above
  2**32 that the declared call round-trips exactly.
* the AST scan below FAILS if any ``user32.``/``shcore.``/``kernel32.`` call site in this tier
  is missing from ``conftest.WIN32_SIGNATURES``, or reaches the API through ``ctypes.windll``
  (a process-wide cached library whose function objects are shared with every other importer,
  so declaring argtypes on it mutates somebody else's calls).

All offline: importable and runnable on any platform.
