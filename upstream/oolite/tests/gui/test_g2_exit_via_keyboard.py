"""G2 - exit the game from the start screen with the KEYBOARD: ``Down`` x5, then ``Enter``.

docs/phases/0-gui-tier.md G2: "Launch -> ``Down``x5 -> ``Enter``", covering "the keyboard path
independently of mouse - a separate SDL3 code path from G1".

Written the way test_g1_exit_via_mouse.py is written and kept SHORT the way
test_g3_exit_via_window_close.py is: the desktop lock, the readiness gate, DPI awareness, the
pinned window, the process-table survivor check and the G9 hygiene asserts are all conftest.py's
and are reused verbatim. This file launches nothing of its own. What it adds is the keyboard
navigation and the evidence that the keyboard is what did it.

THE EXIT CONTEXT CONVERGES WITH G1's. SAID PLAINLY.
---------------------------------------------------
G3's technique is to assert on an observable UNIQUELY attributable to the path under test - the
``@"SDL_QUIT event received"`` context string, unique among the tree's ``-exitAppWithContext:``
call sites. G2 has no such luck AT THE EXIT, and pretending otherwise would be the exact
dishonesty this tier exists to prevent:

    PlayerEntityControls.m:4979-4982
        else if (([gameView isDown:gvMouseDoubleClick] || [self checkKeyPress:n_key_gui_select])
                 && [gui selectedRow] == 6+row_zero)
        {
            [[UNIVERSE gameController] exitAppWithContext:@"Exit Game selected on start screen"];
        }

ONE expression, an ``||`` of the double-click and the select key, reaching ONE
``exitAppWithContext:``. G1 (mouse) and G2 (keyboard) therefore produce a byte-identical
``[exit.context]`` line. That string IS unique in the tree - verified by
``test_the_start_screen_exit_context_is_unique_in_the_tree`` - so asserting it proves the
START-SCREEN ` Exit Game ` ROW ran rather than one of the other exit sites, and it is asserted
here for that reason. It proves NOTHING about keyboard versus mouse, and this file does not
claim it does.

THE KEYBOARD-ONLY OBSERVABLE: WHERE THE SELECTION ENDED UP
-----------------------------------------------------------
The discriminator is upstream of the exit, in HOW THE SELECTION MOVED. This test never moves the
pointer and never presses a mouse button, so the only thing that can move the selection is the
arrow key: ``-[GuiDisplayGen setNextRow:]`` (GuiDisplayGen.m:517) is the game's ONLY relative
selection move, it has exactly TWO call sites in the whole tree (PlayerEntityControls.m:729 and
:749), both inside ``-handleGUIUpDownArrowKeys`` and both gated on ``checkKeyPress:`` of an arrow
key, while that same method's mouse branches (:765-:787) jump ABSOLUTELY to
``UNIVERSE->cursor_row``. All of that is pinned by a tree-wide grep in
``test_a_single_row_step_is_reachable_only_from_the_arrow_keys``.

HOW THE SELECTION IS OBSERVED, AND WHY NOT THE OBVIOUS WAY. ``-reportSelectedRow:``
(GuiDisplayGen.m:572) fires a ``guiSelectedRowChanged`` world-script event, and reading that over
the debug console was the first design. IT DOES NOT WORK, and the measurement is recorded here so
nobody spends the afternoon again: with the handler installed on ``console.script`` and
``typeof`` confirming it was a function, a MOUSE-CONFIRMED row change that demonstrably happened
(``guiScreen`` went to GUI_SCREEN_SHIPLIBRARY) produced an EMPTY trace. A hook that stays empty
through a change that certainly occurred is a dead instrument, and a test built on it would have
been a check that cannot fail.

What IS used is the instrument G5 relies on and which answered correctly throughout:
``guiScreen``. It works as a ROW PROBE because every start-screen row activates a DIFFERENT
screen (PlayerEntityControls.m:4945 ``int row_zero = 21``, :4950-4982):

    row 22 (1+row_zero) -> setGuiToScenarioScreen      => GUI_SCREEN_NEWGAME
    row 24 (3+row_zero) -> setGuiToIntroFirstGo:NO     => GUI_SCREEN_SHIPLIBRARY
    row 25 (4+row_zero) -> setGuiToGameOptionsScreen   => GUI_SCREEN_GAMEOPTIONS
    row 26 (5+row_zero) -> setGuiToOXZManager          => GUI_SCREEN_OXZMANAGER
    row 27 (6+row_zero) -> exitAppWithContext:@"Exit Game selected on start screen"

So "Down x N, then Enter, and the game arrives on the screen row (first+N) leads to" proves the
arrow keys walked exactly N rows. The test uses this TWICE: once as a CALIBRATION that ends on a
screen and is therefore recoverable (Down x2 -> Enter -> GUI_SCREEN_SHIPLIBRARY, proving a single
Down advances exactly one row), and once for real (Down x5 -> Enter -> the process exits). The
calibration is what makes the real press count meaningful rather than assumed: if a Down advanced
zero rows the calibration lands on GUI_SCREEN_NEWGAME, and if it auto-repeated it lands on
GUI_SCREEN_GAMEOPTIONS - both named, both fatal.

WHY THE KEYS ARE SENT WITH SendInput AND NOT pyautogui
-------------------------------------------------------
``game.press_key`` (conftest) sends a SCANCODE with ``KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY``. pyautogui's
Windows backend calls ``keybd_event(vk, 0, 0, 0)`` - no scancode, no extended bit - and Oolite's
SDL3 build dispatches BY SCANCODE, where the arrow cluster shares scancodes with the numeric
keypad. MEASURED: pyautogui ``down`` x2 then Enter landed on GUI_SCREEN_NEWGAME (zero advances);
the same gesture through ``press_key`` landed on GUI_SCREEN_SHIPLIBRARY (exactly two). Space and
Enter arrive either way, which is why G5's Space navigation never hit this.

ROW ADDRESSING IS DERIVED, NOT COUNTED ON FINGERS
-------------------------------------------------
No literal 5, 22 or 27 appears in the navigation. ``start_screen_layout()`` reads
``-setupStartScreenGui`` (PlayerEntity.m) for its ``int initialRow`` and the number of
``oolite-start-option-N`` rows it lays out, and ``exit_row_dispatch()`` reads the start-screen
case of ``-pollDemoControls`` (PlayerEntityControls.m) for its ``int row_zero``, the
``N+row_zero`` offset of the branch that calls ``exitAppWithContext:``, AND the context string
that branch passes. The two derivations must agree on which row is ` Exit Game `, the number of
Down presses is their difference, and the expected context is the one the source actually
contains.
