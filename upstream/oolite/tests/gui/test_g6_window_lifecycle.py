"""G6 - window lifecycle: resize, minimise/restore, fullscreen.

docs/phases/0-gui-tier.md G6: "Resize, minimise/restore, fullscreen toggle. GL context survival."

Written the way test_g3_exit_via_window_close.py is written: SHORT where it can be, and reusing
conftest.py wholesale. The desktop lock, the readiness gate, DPI awareness, the pinned window,
the survivor check and the G9 hygiene asserts are G1's and are not repeated here. What this file
adds is the three lifecycle gestures and - the part that makes it a test rather than a sequence
of API calls - a pair of INDEPENDENT witnesses for each one.

WHY AN API CALL RETURNING SUCCESS PROVES NOTHING
------------------------------------------------
``SetWindowPos`` returning TRUE says the request was accepted, not that the window is that size;
``ShowWindow(SW_MINIMIZE)`` does not even return success (its BOOL is the PREVIOUS visibility);
and a synthetic F12 that the game never sampled returns exactly what one it did sample returns.
So every gesture below is judged by TWO observables that the gesture did not produce:

* THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S ANSWER - ``GetClientRect``/``GetWindowRect`` for geometry,
  ``IsIconic`` and ``GetWindowPlacement().showCmd`` for the minimised state, and the monitor's
  own ``rcMonitor`` (``MonitorFromWindow`` + ``GetMonitorInfoW``) for what "covers the screen"
  means on THIS machine.
* THE GAME'S OWN ANSWER - read out of the running process over the debug console, exactly as G5
  reads ``guiScreen``. ``oolite.gameSettings.gameWindow`` is Universe.m:4538-4542:
  ``[gameView backingViewSize].width/.height`` and
  ``[[self gameController] inFullScreenMode]``.

An OS rectangle alone would prove Windows moved a window; it would NOT prove the game reacted.
A game-side property alone would prove an instance variable changed; it would not prove anything
happened on screen. Both, for each gesture, is the claim.

WHAT MAKES THE GAME-SIDE OBSERVABLE ATTRIBUTABLE (and the guards that pin it)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
``backingViewSize`` is ``bounds.size`` (MyOpenGLView.m:679-682), and ``bounds.size`` is assigned
in EXACTLY ONE place in the whole source tree - MyOpenGLView.m:514, the first line of
``-updateGLSize:``. ``-updateGLSize:`` is called from exactly two places: the resize handler at
MyOpenGLView+Input.m:679 and ``-initialiseGLWithSize:`` at MyOpenGLView.m:615. So reading the
size we asked for back out of the live game proves ``-updateGLSize:`` ran in THIS process with
THAT size - i.e. the game recomputed ``display_z``, ``x_offset``/``y_offset`` and its
``glViewport``. That is the same class of evidence G3 accepted for SDL_EVENT_QUIT's context
string and G5 accepted for ``guiScreen``, and
``test_the_games_view_size_has_exactly_one_assignment_in_the_tree`` fails if it ever stops being
unique.

The route from the OS resize to that assignment is equally singular:
``resize_pending = true`` occurs once in the tree (MyOpenGLView+Input.m:635) and it is inside the
``SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_PIXEL_SIZE_CHANGED`` case, so the game only reaches ``-updateGLSize:`` at all
by having been TOLD by the window system that its pixel size changed.

Fullscreen is the same shape. ``inFullScreenMode`` answers ``fullScreen``
(MyOpenGLView.m:715-718), and after start-up the only thing that assigns ``fullScreen`` is
``-setFullScreenMode:`` (MyOpenGLView.m:723); the only caller of ``-toggleScreenMode`` in the
tree is the ``SDLK_F12`` case at MyOpenGLView+Input.m:471. The gesture is therefore a real F12
through ``SendInput`` - the tier's own scancode path, which G2 measured as the only way this
SDL3 build actually receives a key - and not a JS call, which would prove a function works
rather than that the key does. The log carries the second witness: ``-initialiseGLWithSize:``
logs "Requested a new surface of W x H, fullscreen." (MyOpenGLView.m:591-592), and the word
``fullscreen`` in that line cannot be produced by any windowed path.

RELATIONSHIPS, NOT MAGIC PIXELS
-------------------------------
Nothing here asserts a size this test did not itself cause. The resize target is chosen by this
file; the assertion is that the client rect IS that, that the game reports THAT, and that both
differ from what they were before. "Fullscreen covers the screen" is measured against the
monitor the window is on. "Restore put it back" is measured against the rectangle recorded
immediately before the minimise AND against ``rcNormalPosition``, which Windows itself
remembers. A test that asserted 1024x768 because this machine happens to use it would be a
flake on any other display.

THE SHARED DESKTOP AND THE SHARED BUILD
---------------------------------------
Five agents share this machine. Two consequences, both handled rather than hoped about:

* EVERY measurement re-checks that the hwnd it is about to read belongs to the pid this test
  launched (``assert_window_is_ours``). conftest._pin_window parks EVERY instance at (0,0) at
  960x720, so a sibling's window is pixel-identical to ours and would satisfy any assertion
  that did not check ownership.
* The game WRITES the window size it ends up with into its preferences (``-saveWindowSize:``,
  MyOpenGLView.m:1309-1315, reached from the resize handler at MyOpenGLView+Input.m:683), and
  ``-setFullScreenMode:`` writes the ``fullscreen`` key. Against the shared build that would
  mutate ``<build>/oolite.app/GNUstep/Defaults/oolite.plist`` for every other tier on the
  machine. So this file overrides ``app_dir`` with a PRIVATE staged app, exactly as
  test_g7_first_run_creates_defaults.py does and with the same audited helpers
  (tests/launch_snapshot.py ``stage_app``/``unstage_app``): junctions for the read-only
  directories, real copies for the three the game writes. The shared prefs file is never
  touched, and ``test_the_staged_app_is_private_and_the_shared_build_is_read_only`` pins it.

Finally, the window is put back the way the tier hands it over - pinned at (0,0) at
PINNED_CLIENT_SIZE - before the game is asked to exit, so nothing this test moved outlives it.

    python3 -m pytest upstream/oolite/tests/gui/test_g6_window_lifecycle.py -x -q

Needs the desktop: a real window, unlocked and logged in (ADR-0017). It takes tools/gui-lock for
the duration, via the ``game`` fixture - this file launches nothing of its own.
