"""G4 - start a game: confirm ` Start New Commander `, then ` Normal Start `, and the HUD renders.

docs/phases/0-gui-tier.md G4: "Launch -> confirm row 22 -> land on scenario screen -> confirm row 3
(`Normal Start`) -> wait for the cockpit -> assert the HUD renders -> exit". The end-to-end smoke
test: it is the only one in this tier that leaves the start screen at all, so it is the only one
that can catch "the menu works but the game never starts".

Written the way test_g3_exit_via_window_close.py is written - SHORT, and reusing everything
conftest.py already owns (the desktop lock, the readiness gate, DPI awareness, row->point, the
process-table survivor check, the G9 hygiene assert). This file launches nothing of its own.

HOW THE ROWS ARE ADDRESSED, AND WHY AN INDEX IS UNAVOIDABLE
-----------------------------------------------------------
The source offers NO symbolic name for either row this test presses, and that is a fact about the
game rather than a shortcut here:

* ``PlayerEntity.m:9912`` - the start screen is built with a bare ``int initialRow = 22;`` and six
  successive ``++row``. The rows carry keys (``Start:22`` ... ``Start:27``) but the KEYS ARE NEVER
  READ: ``PlayerEntityControls.m:4950-4982`` dispatches on ``[gui selectedRow] == N+row_zero`` with
  a second bare ``int row_zero = 21``. There is no enum, no #define, and no key lookup to name.
* ``PlayerEntity.h:164`` DOES name the scenario screen's first row -
  ``GUI_ROW_SCENARIOS_START = 3`` - and ``PlayerEntityLoadSave.m:214`` starts the scenario list
  there, so ` Normal Start ` (scenarios.plist entry 0) is addressed by THAT constant, mirrored
  here, rather than by the literal 3.

So one row is semantic and one cannot be. The brief's fallback is therefore what this file does for
BOTH presses: **assert which screen you are on before pressing**. ``assert_on_start_screen`` and
``assert_on_scenario_screen`` read the game's own rendered frame and check the row OCCUPANCY
PATTERN each screen's builder produces - the start screen fills rows 22-27 and leaves row 1 empty;
the scenario screen fills row 1 (` Return to Menu `, ``start_row - 2``) and leaves 22-27 empty. A
layout change that moved either menu therefore fails LOUDLY, by name, instead of silently
double-clicking whatever now sits at that index.

WHAT "THE HUD RENDERS" IS ASSERTED ON
-------------------------------------
Not "the process is alive", not "a window exists", and not a desktop screenshot: the observable is
the SCANNER GRID ELLIPSE in a frame THE GAME ITSELF read back out of its own framebuffer
(``MyOpenGLView.m:1194-1214`` ``glReadPixels`` -> PNG, into this run's private
``$OO_SNAPSHOTSDIR``, which conftest points at pytest's ``tmp_path``).

That ellipse is uniquely attributable to a rendered HUD, by a call chain each link of which has
exactly ONE call site in the tree (verified by grep over src/ and Resources/):

    Universe.m:5239   [theHUD renderHUD]          <- the only renderHUD: call site
    HeadUpDisplay.m:832  [self drawDials]         <- the only drawDials call site
    HeadUpDisplay.m:1235 drawScannerGrid(...)     <- the only drawScannerGrid call site,
                                                     inside -drawScanner:, which is reached only
                                                     through the "drawScanner:" selector in
                                                     Resources/Config/hud.plist:21

and ``Universe.m:5225-5232`` skips ``renderHUD`` outright for ``STATUS_START_GAME``, which is the
status the game sits in for the whole of the menu flow. So red pixels on that ellipse cannot be
produced by a game that never left the menu.

The ellipse's position is COMPUTED, not image-matched (docs/phases/0-gui-tier.md, "compute, don't
image-match"): hud.plist's ``x=0, y=68, y_origin=-1, width=288`` through the projection in
``MyOpenGLView.m:519-527``. And it is asserted DIFFERENTIALLY inside the one run - the identical
measurement is taken on the start screen and on the scenario screen first, where it must be empty -
so a stray red thing on the desktop, a leftover file, or a broken measurement fails the test rather
than passing it.

Needs the desktop: a real window, unlocked and logged in (ADR-0017). It takes tools/gui-lock for
the duration, via the ``game`` fixture - this file launches nothing of its own.
