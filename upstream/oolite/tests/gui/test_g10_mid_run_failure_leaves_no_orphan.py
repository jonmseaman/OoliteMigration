"""A GUI test that fails MID-RUN, with the game up, must leave no orphaned oolite.exe.

Bead oo-njnw. The bead was filed as a defect: "conftest's shared ``game`` fixture does not take
the process down when a test fails while the game is up; an oolite.exe SURVIVES the run", with a
reviewer's report of an ``assert False`` injected into test_g1_exit_via_mouse.py on pristine main
leaving a survivor behind.

THAT DEFECT DOES NOT EXIST, and this file is the evidence that it does not, pinned so it cannot
come back. Measured by reproducing that injection exactly - a scratch copy of
test_g1_exit_via_mouse.py with ``assert False`` placed after step 1's ``select_row``, i.e. with
the game demonstrably up - and recording the pid the run itself launched:

    current main 602219c    rc=1, "1 failed, 38 passed in 27.66s", launched pid 11144 -> GONE
    pristine     fd501c4    rc=1, "1 failed, 38 passed in 26.51s", launched pid  6384 -> GONE

fd501c4 is the very tree the bead was filed against, so this is not a leak some later bead fixed
by accident: the teardown was already correct, and ``GameWindow.kill`` is byte-identical between
the two trees. The original sighting was a CONCURRENT AGENT'S oolite.exe - five agents share this
desktop - and a bare ``tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq oolite.exe"`` cannot tell that from a leak of
one's own. Recording the launched pid and asking about THAT pid is what distinguishes them, and it
is why every assertion here is pid-scoped.

WHY THE TEARDOWN IS SOUND, which is the property this file locks. ``game`` is a generator fixture
whose ``yield`` sits inside a ``try/finally``. When a test body raises, pytest throws that
exception into the generator at the yield point, so ``finally: window.kill()`` runs during the
unwind - identically for a passing test and a failing one. There is no separate failure path.

HOW THE MID-RUN FAILURE IS STAGED. A test cannot fail deliberately AND then assert on what its
own teardown did: its assertions would never run. So the failure happens in a CHILD pytest
process and the assertions happen here, in the parent. The child test file is written into THIS
directory, so the ``conftest.py`` it binds to is this tier's real one - the shared fixture itself,
unmodified, not a reimplementation and not a private copy of its body. The child records the pid
it launched to a file, fails while the game is up, and the parent then asserts that pid is gone
from the operating system's process table.

The child file is named ``_njnw_child_*.py`` rather than ``test_*.py`` so that a normal tier run
never collects it, the tier-wide AST meta-guard in test_g9_post_exit_hygiene.py (which walks
``os.listdir`` for ``test_*.py``) never sees it, and it is removed in a ``finally`` either way.

    python3 -m pytest upstream/oolite/tests/gui/test_g10_mid_run_failure_leaves_no_orphan.py -q

FALSIFIABILITY, measured rather than asserted - see the bead's evidence. With
``GameWindow.kill``'s ``self.proc.kill()`` neutered in a scratch copy of the tier, this test goes
RED and names the surviving pid. The committed conftest.py is untouched by this bead.

Needs the desktop: a real window, unlocked and logged in (ADR-0017). The child run takes
tools/gui-lock through the shared fixture, so this test releases the lock before spawning it (it
holds none of its own) and launches nothing directly.

    THE LOCK, which is the subtle part and was a real self-deadlock in review. This tier's
    ``game`` fixture depends on the session-scoped ``desktop_lock``, so the child would try to
    acquire tools/gui-lock - the exclusive desktop mutex THIS TEST'S OWN SESSION already holds.
    Parent and child would then wait on each other until the child's timeout: measured, the pin
    passed alone in ~10s and hung for the full 300s budget when run with the rest of the
    launching tier. A longer timeout would not have fixed it, only hidden a deadlock behind a
    slower wait.

    So the child is given a PRIVATE lock directory in ``OO_GUI_LOCK_DIR``, which both
    tools/gui-lock (``lock_dir()``) and conftest's bash-less fallback (``_lock_path()``) honour.
    That is sound rather than a loophole: desktop exclusivity for this test is supplied by the
    PARENT, which takes the real ``desktop_lock`` fixture and holds it across the child's whole
    run, so at no point is an unlocked game on the desktop. The child's private mutex only stops
    it from queueing behind its own parent. It is a fresh empty directory per run, so the child
    never contends with anything and never reclaims anyone's lock.

    THIS IS NOT COMPENSATING FOR THE STALE LOCK, and that was measured rather than assumed. A
    separate fleet defect - a lock orphaned by a dead session, reclaimed under the script's own
    age-based protocol and filed as oo-c7bu - produced failures that LOOKED like this deadlock,
    so the two had to be told apart deliberately. Removing only the ``OO_GUI_LOCK_DIR`` line
    below, from a CLEAN and verified-free lock, still fails: the child never writes its pidfile
    and dies with "1 error in 29.89s", the parent failing at the pidfile assertion after 39s.
    That is the child hitting its 30s acquisition budget on the mutex its own parent is holding,
    with no stale lock anywhere in the picture. The private directory is therefore load-bearing
    on its own merits and is kept.
