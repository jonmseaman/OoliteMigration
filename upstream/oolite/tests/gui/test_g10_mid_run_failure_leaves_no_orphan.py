"""A GUI test that fails MID-RUN, with the game up, must leave no orphaned oolite.exe.

Bead oo-njnw. The bead was filed as a defect: "conftest's shared ``game`` fixture does not take
the process down when a test fails while the game is up; an oolite.exe SURVIVES the run", with a
reviewer's report of an ``assert False`` injected into test_g1_exit_via_mouse.py on pristine main
leaving a survivor behind.

THAT DEFECT DOES NOT EXIST, and this file is the evidence that it does not, pinned so it cannot
come back. Measured by reproducing that injection exactly - a scratch copy of
test_g1_exit_via_mouse.py with ``assert False`` placed after step 1's ``select_row``, i.e. with
the game demonstrably up - and recording the pid the run itself launched:

    current main 602219c    rc=1, "1 failed, 38 passed in 27.66s", launched pid 11144 -> GONE
    pristine     fd501c4    rc=1, "1 failed, 38 passed in 26.51s", launched pid  6384 -> GONE

fd501c4 is the very tree the bead was filed against, so this is not a leak some later bead fixed
by accident: the teardown was already correct, and ``GameWindow.kill`` is byte-identical between
the two trees. The original sighting was a CONCURRENT AGENT'S oolite.exe - five agents share this
desktop - and a bare ``tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq oolite.exe"`` cannot tell that from a leak of
one's own. Recording the launched pid and asking about THAT pid is what distinguishes them, and it
is why every assertion here is pid-scoped.

WHY THE TEARDOWN IS SOUND, which is the property this file locks. ``game`` is a generator fixture
whose ``yield`` sits inside a ``try/finally``. When a test body raises, pytest throws that
exception into the generator at the yield point, so ``finally: window.kill()`` runs during the
unwind - identically for a passing test and a failing one. There is no separate failure path.

HOW THE MID-RUN FAILURE IS STAGED. A test cannot fail deliberately AND then assert on what its
own teardown did: its assertions would never run. So the failure happens in a CHILD pytest
process and the assertions happen here, in the parent. The child test file is written into THIS
directory, so the ``conftest.py`` it binds to is this tier's real one - the shared fixture itself,
unmodified, not a reimplementation and not a private copy of its body. The child records the pid
it launched to a file, fails while the game is up, and the parent then asserts that pid is gone
from the operating system's process table.

The child file is named ``_njnw_child_*.py`` rather than ``test_*.py`` so that a normal tier run
never collects it, the tier-wide AST meta-guard in test_g9_post_exit_hygiene.py (which walks
``os.listdir`` for ``test_*.py``) never sees it, and it is removed in a ``finally`` either way.

    python3 -m pytest upstream/oolite/tests/gui/test_g10_mid_run_failure_leaves_no_orphan.py -q

FALSIFIABILITY, measured rather than asserted - see the bead's evidence. With
``GameWindow.kill``'s ``self.proc.kill()`` neutered in a scratch copy of the tier, this test goes
RED and names the surviving pid. The committed conftest.py is untouched by this bead.

Needs the desktop: a real window, unlocked and logged in (ADR-0017). The child run takes
tools/gui-lock through the shared fixture, so this test releases the lock before spawning it (it
holds none of its own) and launches nothing directly.
