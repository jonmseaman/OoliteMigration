# GUI test tier

PyAutoGUI smoke tests that drive the game through **real OS-level mouse and keyboard input
against a real window**. Specified in
[`docs/phases/0-gui-tier.md`](../../../../docs/phases/0-gui-tier.md); the seam and exemplar is
[G1](../../../../docs/stories/G1-exit-via-mouse.md).

```bash
tools/gui-tier.sh upstream/oolite/tests/gui/test_g1_exit_via_mouse.py
```

Run it through `tools/gui-tier.sh`, not bare `pytest`. The runner installs
[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) — nothing else in the repository does, so without it the
missing-`pyautogui` case is the *expected* case — and exports `OO_GUI_REQUIRE=1`.

**A skip is a silent pass.** On Windows, a missing `pyautogui` is a hard `pytest.fail` naming the
install command, never an `importorskip`. The one legitimate skip is a non-Windows host, where
this tier genuinely does not apply (ADR-0017); `OO_GUI_REQUIRE=1` turns even that into a failure,
so a run that was *supposed* to exercise G1 cannot come back green from the wrong machine.
`tools/setup-windows.sh` installs `pyautogui` too, for a machine set up once up front.

It needs a **real desktop**: logged in, unlocked, and not doing anything else, because the tier
takes the desktop exclusively while it runs ([ADR-0017](../../../../docs/decisions/0017-native-windows-subtree.md)).
That exclusion is `tools/gui-lock`, taken by the session-scoped `desktop_lock` fixture. It runs
in Tier C and nightly, **never per bead**. An RDP disconnect takes the desktop with it.

It also needs a built game: by default `upstream/oolite/build/meson_test/oolite.app`, overridden
with `--oolite-app <path>` or `OO_APP_DIR`.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---:|---|
| `OO_GUI_READY_TIMEOUT` | `180` | How long to wait for `startup.complete` in the game's log. |
| `OO_GUI_SETTLE` | `5` | Seconds for the start screen to draw once the game reports ready. |
| `OO_GUI_LOCK_DIR` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\oolite-gui-desktop.lock` | Where the desktop mutex lives. Must match `tools/gui-lock`. |
| `OO_GUI_LOCK_TIMEOUT` | `900` | How long to queue for the desktop. |
| `OO_GUI_LOCK_STALE` | `1800` | Age at which a lock is assumed abandoned and reclaimed. |
| `OO_APP_DIR` | the test build | Which `oolite.app` to drive. |

## What conftest.py gives G2-G9

| Name | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `row_to_point(row, client_rect)` | function | Row -> absolute screen point, computed from the window rect and the fixed virtual grid. Raises `ValueError` for a row the cursor clamp cannot reach, rather than silently returning a point that selects its neighbour. |
| `point_to_row(x, y, client_rect)` | function | The inverse, walking the same chain the game does. Lets the maths be tested with no game running. |
| `game` | fixture | One process with a real, pinned window, ready and focused; killed unconditionally on teardown. `game.select_row`, `game.confirm_row`, `game.client_rect`. |
| `desktop_lock` | fixture | Session-scoped, takes `tools/gui-lock`. |
| `assert_clean_exit(game)` | function | G9 hygiene, all checks unconditional: no crash dump, no `ERROR` in `Latest.log` (an *absent* log is a failure, not a skip), and a GNUstep defaults file that **this run wrote** and that still parses. Takes the `game` fixture, which carries the launch-time defaults mark; the explicit `assert_clean_exit(output_dir, app_dir, defaults_launch_mark)` form is for tests that synthesise directories. Returns `(path, contents)` of the defaults file. |
| `defaults_write_mark(app_dir)` | function | The mtimes of every candidate defaults path, recorded by `GameWindow.start()` **before** launch. Without it "the defaults file exists and parses" is true forever — `app_dir` is the persistent build tree — and the check cannot fail. |
| `assert_no_surviving_game_processes(root_pid)` | function | No `oolite.exe` in the launched process tree is still alive. Scoped to that tree, so a concurrent sibling run is not mistaken for a leak. |

## Three things that are not what you would guess

**1. A single click selects; it does not activate.** `PlayerEntityControls.m:765-780` - a left
click only calls `setSelectedRow:`. Activation is Enter or a double-click. A test that
single-clicks ` Exit Game ` and waits sits on the start screen until it times out.

**2. The window you first see is not the window you click.** The game creates a surface during
init and re-creates it at the end of startup (`Requested a new surface of ... windowed`), so a
resize applied before `startup.complete` is silently discarded and every early click is dropped.
Readiness is therefore read from the game's own log line, never slept for.

**3. Mesa's software `opengl32.dll` is fatal here.** The component tier stages llvmpipe beside
the binary so a headless VM can render offscreen; with it present the game dies during `initGL`
with `0x80070057` and never opens a window. The `game` fixture moves those DLLs aside for the
duration and puts them back on teardown.

**4. The defaults file is OpenStep, not XML.** `src/SDL/main.m:119` points `GNUSTEP_USERS_ROOT`
at the directory holding `oolite.exe`, so this run's user defaults land in
`<app_dir>/GNUstep/Defaults/oolite.plist`, and gnustep-base writes them in the old-style
`{ "key" = "value"; }` dialect that `plistlib` cannot read. `GameController.m:905` synchronizes
them as the last act of `-exitAppWithContext:`, which is why "the defaults file still parses" is
a real post-exit check: a shutdown that died mid-write leaves a truncated file. `conftest.py`
carries a strict OpenStep parser for exactly this — strict because a lenient one would turn a
half-written file back into a silent pass (bug oo-5rsa).

**5. "The defaults file exists" is not "this run wrote it."** `app_dir` is the *persistent*
build tree, so a plist left behind by a run last month satisfies "exists and parses" forever —
a reviewer falsified the first fix for this bug by backdating the file 30 days and watching the
check pass with the run having written nothing. `GameWindow.start()` therefore records
`defaults_write_mark(app_dir)` **before** `Popen`, and the post-exit check demands a file
strictly newer than that mark (or absent at launch and present afterwards). That is the half of
`docs/stories/G1-exit-via-mouse.md:52`'s "defaults file **written** and re-parseable" that a
timestamp-free check cannot express.
