# oo-sjvz DETERMINISM FIX (S1/S2/S5/S6 flakiness, docs/fleet/LEARNINGS.md oo-qwk5/oo-rkm):
# system.addShips(role, ...) draws the ship TYPE at random (Universe.m:4008 -newShipWithRole: ->
# :3948 -randomShipKeyForRoleRespectingConditions: -> OOShipRegistry.m:276-279
# [[self probabilitySetForRole:role] randomObject]), so spawning "police" or "pirate" by role
# hands a component scenario a different ship class - with a different max_energy, weapon
# loadout and starting bounty - on every run even at a pinned seed. Measured by oo-qwk5: ~24% of
# role-spawned pirates were not even legally attackable by police, because their random starting
# bounty fell below policeAI's fineThreshold() gate (oolite-priorityai.js:845,
# `50 - government*6`). That is what made S1/S2/S5/S6 a coin flip unrelated to the code under
# test.

# The fix pins the SHIP KEY that addShips is actually asked for, using the literal "[shipKey]"
# form that OOShipRegistry.m:1229 auto-registers at probability 1.0 for every ship (no draw),
# entirely INSIDE the existing spawn steps' implementation - no .feature file changes and no new
# step text, since a step's WORDING is what every scenario's vocabulary and guardrails' test-unit
# classifier (tools/guardrails.sh:695-714) key off. Choosing which key backs a role is a fact
