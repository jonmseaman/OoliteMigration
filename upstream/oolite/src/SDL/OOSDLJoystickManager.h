OOSDLJoystickManager.h
By Dylan Smith

JoystickHandler handles joystick events from SDL, and translates them
into the appropriate action via a lookup table. The lookup table is
stored as a simple array rather than an ObjC dictionary since this
will be examined fairly often (once per frame during gameplay).

Conversion methods are provided to convert between the internal
representation and a property-list dictionary (for loading/saving user defaults
and for use in areas where portability/ease of coding are more important
than performance such as the GUI)

C++20 since bead oo-o89, the Phase 3 platform (SDL/) pattern (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-o89).
The SDL half of the joystick manager is cxx::OOSDLJoystickManager. Its superclass,
OOJoystickManager, is still Objective-C, so the Objective-C OOSDLJoystickManager in
OOSDLJoystickManager+ObjCBridge.h (imported at the end of this header) stays the subclass that
superclass creates and messages; it owns the C++ object and forwards its overrides to it. Until
OOJoystickManager converts, the C++ object is made only by that facade's -init: the superclass's
state (and its decoders, which handleSDLEvent() reaches through oo::ToObjC(this)) lives in the
facade.
