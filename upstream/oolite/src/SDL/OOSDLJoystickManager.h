OOSDLJoystickManager.h
By Dylan Smith

JoystickHandler handles joystick events from SDL, and translates them
into the appropriate action via a lookup table. The lookup table is
stored as a simple array rather than an ObjC dictionary since this
will be examined fairly often (once per frame during gameplay).

Conversion methods are provided to convert between the internal
representation and a property-list dictionary (for loading/saving user defaults
and for use in areas where portability/ease of coding are more important
than performance such as the GUI)
