/*	oofnd/objc/OOObjCPeer.h
	oo::ObjCPeers: at most one live Objective-C peer per C++ object (proposed ADR-0056, bead
	oo-11m). Phase 3 converts a class to C++ while most of its callers are still Objective-C; they
	keep compiling against a thin Objective-C facade of the same name (X+ObjCBridge.h) that holds
	an oo::Ref to the C++ object. This table makes the facade faithful to identity: handing the
	same C++ object to Objective-C twice gives the same facade while that facade lives, so ==,
	-isEqual:, -hash and a PList::Object node behave as they did when there was one object.

	    in X+ObjCBridge.mm                                    what it does
	    ----------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------
	    static oo::ObjCPeers &Peers()                         one table per facade class, made on first
	    { static auto *p = new oo::ObjCPeers; return *p; }    use and never destroyed (a facade may be
	                                                          released while the process exits)
	    Peers().peerFor(cxx, [&] { return [[X alloc] ...]; }) the live peer, else the one make() gives
	                                                          (+1, adopted); autoreleased; nil for null
	    Peers().forget(cxx) in the facade's -dealloc          drops the entry once no peer is alive
	    Peers().livePeer(cxx)                                 the live peer, +0 and not autoreleased, or nil

	SEMANTICS
	  * The table holds each peer WEAKLY (libobjc2's zeroing weak references, objc_initWeak and
	    objc_loadWeakRetained), so it never keeps a facade alive; the facade keeps the C++ object
	    alive through its oo::Ref ivar. A facade whose count has reached zero reads as dead here
	    before its -dealloc runs, so a concurrent peerFor() never resurrects it: it makes a new peer.
	  * forget() erases the entry only if its peer is dead: a peer made for the same object between
	    the old one's final release and its -dealloc keeps its entry.
	  * One mutex per table. make() runs under it, so it must not call back into the same table
	    (a facade initialiser only stores its ivar); nothing is released or autoreleased under it.
	  * Keys are C++ object addresses. An entry exists only while a peer that retains its object
	    may exist, so an address is not reused while it has an entry.

	Header-only, Objective-C++. It includes no Foundation and links against libobjc2 alone.
	Deleted with the last facade (Phase 3 exit: zero @implementation).
