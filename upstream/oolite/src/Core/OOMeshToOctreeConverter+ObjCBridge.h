OOMeshToOctreeConverter+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-rsk8): the Objective-C OOMeshToOctreeConverter, a facade
over the C++ cxx::OOMeshToOctreeConverter (OOMeshToOctreeConverter.h), for its caller that is not
converted yet (OOMesh's -octree). Its interface is the one OOMeshToOctreeConverter.h declared
before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types), so that caller compiles and
behaves unchanged; each method forwards to its C++ member. Imported as the last line of
OOMeshToOctreeConverter.h; do not import it directly.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  ----------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OOMeshToOctreeConverter *       nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        oo::Ref<cxx::OOMeshToOctreeConverter>
	  handing a converter to Objective-C                                    oo::ToObjC(converter)
	  taking one from Objective-C                                           oo::ToCxx(objcConverter)

oo::ToObjC gives the converter's one live facade (oo::ObjCPeers), so identity survives a round
trip. Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade. Deleted by its deletion
bead once no file outside OOMeshToOctreeConverter.* names the Objective-C OOMeshToOctreeConverter.
