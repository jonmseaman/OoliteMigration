OOALBufferedSound.h

OOALBufferedSound - OpenAL sound implementation for Oolite.

C++20 since bead oo-2wpb (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en): a subclass of
cxx::OOSound. Bead oo-9ht.83 deleted its Objective-C facade and moved it to the global namespace;
the root's class cluster makes it, and it crosses to Objective-C as the root's facade, an OOSound.
