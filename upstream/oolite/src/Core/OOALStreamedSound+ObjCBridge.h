OOALStreamedSound+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en): the Objective-C OOALStreamedSound, a
facade over the C++ cxx::OOALStreamedSound (OOALStreamedSound.h), for the root's class cluster
(cxx::OOSound::initWithContentsOfFile in OOALSound.mm), which makes it by alloc/init and whose test
stubs this class by name (amendment oo-rmd7 item 3). Its interface is the one OOALStreamedSound.h declared
before the conversion, copied exactly; like a converted class's facade in a hierarchy (amendment
oo-up4b item 3) it has no ivars, because the root's facade holds its C++ part. oo::ToObjC answers it
for a cxx::OOALStreamedSound by the C++ class's name. Imported as the last line of OOALStreamedSound.h; do not import it
directly. Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade.
