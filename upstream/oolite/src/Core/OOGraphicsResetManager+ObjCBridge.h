OOGraphicsResetManager+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-jpd8): the Objective-C OOGraphicsResetManager, a facade
over the C++ cxx::OOGraphicsResetManager (OOGraphicsResetManager.h), for callers that are not
converted yet, and the OOGraphicsResetClient protocol its clients adopt. Both are copied exactly
from OOGraphicsResetManager.h before the conversion, so callers and clients compile and behave
unchanged; each method forwards to its C++ member. Imported as the last line of
OOGraphicsResetManager.h; do not import it directly.

The manager is a singleton: +sharedManager answers one facade for the life of the process
(proposed ADR-0056 amendment oo-r7m0, item 5). A client stays an Objective-C object until a C++
client exists (amendment oo-jpd8). Never add to this file; converted code does not message the
facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once no file outside OOGraphicsResetManager.* names the
Objective-C class or the protocol.
