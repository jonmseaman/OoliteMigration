OOALSoundMixer+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en): the Objective-C OOSoundMixer,
a facade over the C++ cxx::OOSoundMixer (OOALSoundMixer.h), for the code that messages the mixer:
the sound sources, the root sound's +update (OOALSound.mm) and OOOpenALController::shutdown(), whose
tests stub this class (amendment oo-rmd7 item 3). Its interface is the one OOALSoundMixer.h declared
before the conversion, copied exactly. +sharedMixer answers one facade for the life of the process
(amendment oo-r7m0 item 5). Imported as the last line of OOALSoundMixer.h; do not import it
directly. Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade.
