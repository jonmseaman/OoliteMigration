OOALSound+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-2en): the Objective-C OOSound, a facade over the
C++ cxx::OOSound (OOALSound.h), for the callers that message sounds (the sound sources, the
channels, the resource manager, the player, the JavaScript Sound class) and for the sounds not
converted yet (OOALBufferedSound, OOALStreamedSound, OOMusic). Its interface is the one OOALSound.h
declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types), so they compile and
behave unchanged. Imported as the last line of OOALSound.h; do not import it directly.

It is a hierarchy root's facade, as OODrawable+ObjCBridge.h is; the table there applies here:

	the sound is                         its facade is                      virtual calls on the
	                                                                          C++ side reach
	-----------------------------------  ---------------------------------  ---------------------
	an Objective-C subclass              the subclass instance itself, and  the subclass's
	  (unconverted, [[X alloc] init])    an adapter is its C++ part         methods
	a C++ subclass (converted)           made by oo::ToObjC, one live one   the C++ overrides
	                                     per sound (oo::ObjCPeers)

-cxx_initWithContentsOfFile: answers another object than its receiver (an OOALBufferedSound or
an OOALStreamedSound, which cxx::OOSound::initWithContentsOfFile makes); a subclass that overrides
it (OOMusic) still does. A converted caller that keeps a sound while any subclass is Objective-C
holds oo::ObjCRef<OOSound *>: an Objective-C sound's C++ part does not retain it.

A converted subclass that its callers make by alloc/init (OOALStreamedSound) has a facade of its
own, a subclass of this one with no ivars (amendment oo-up4b item 3): oo::ToObjC picks the
Objective-C class named as the C++ class is, else OOSound. OOALBufferedSound's facade was deleted
by bead oo-9ht.83: its sounds cross as OOSound, which the class cluster makes with
-initWithNewCxxSound:.

oo::ToObjC(oo::ToCxx(s)) == s for both kinds. Never add to this file; converted code does not
message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once every caller and every sound is C++.
