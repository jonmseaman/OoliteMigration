OOALSoundChannel+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en): the Objective-C
OOSoundChannel, a facade over the C++ cxx::OOSoundChannel (OOALSoundChannel.h), for the mixer,
which makes the channels by alloc/init, and the sound sources, which message them; both stub this
class in their tests (amendment oo-rmd7 item 3). Its interface is the one OOALSoundChannel.h
declared before the conversion, copied exactly, and so is the delegate category, which moves here
with it (as a protocol does: amendment oo-jpd8 item 1). Imported as the last line of
OOALSoundChannel.h; do not import it directly.

oo::ToObjC(oo::ToCxx(c)) == c. Never add to this file; converted code does not message the
facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once the mixer and the sources are C++.
