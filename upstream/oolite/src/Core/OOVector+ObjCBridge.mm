OOVector+ObjCBridge.mm

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-86ek): the Objective-C OONativeVector facade over
cxx::OONativeVector. Every method forwards to its C++ member. -initWithVector: makes and owns the
C++ box and records itself as its facade, as callers still make boxes with alloc/init.
Deleted with OOVector+ObjCBridge.h.
