OODrawable+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-smy): the Objective-C OODrawable, a facade over the
C++ cxx::OODrawable (OODrawable.h), for the callers that message drawables (the entities) and for
the drawables not converted yet (OOMesh, OOPlanetDrawable, OOSkyDrawable). Its interface is the
one OODrawable.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types), so
they compile and behave unchanged. Imported as the last line of OODrawable.h; do not import it
directly.

It is a hierarchy root's facade, as OOMaterial+ObjCBridge.h is; the tables there apply here:

	the drawable is                      its facade is                      virtual calls on the
	                                                                          C++ side reach
	-----------------------------------  ---------------------------------  ---------------------
	an Objective-C subclass              the subclass instance itself, and  the subclass's
	  (unconverted, [[X alloc] init])    an adapter is its C++ part         methods
	a C++ subclass (converted)           made by oo::ToObjC, one live one   the C++ overrides
	                                     per drawable (oo::ObjCPeers), of
	                                     the subclass's own facade class
	                                     if it has one (OOMesh), else this

A converted subclass that its callers message by its own selectors (cxx::OOMesh) has a facade of
its own, an Objective-C subclass of this one with the C++ class's name and no ivars (amendments
oo-up4b item 3 and oo-dnbf); its initialisers make the C++ drawable with -initWithNewCxxDrawable:.

A converted caller that keeps a drawable while any subclass is Objective-C holds
oo::ObjCRef<OODrawable *>: an Objective-C drawable's C++ part does not retain it.

A subclass that copies itself bitwise (OOMesh's -mutableCopyWithZone:, NSCopyObject's
replacement) calls oo::ConstructCxxPartOfCopy on the copy, where it constructs its own C++ ivars
afresh: the copied ivar is the original's C++ part.

oo::ToObjC(oo::ToCxx(d)) == d for both kinds. Never add to this file; converted code does not
message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once every caller and every drawable is C++.
