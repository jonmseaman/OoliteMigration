OOALMusic+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en): the Objective-C OOMusic, a
facade over the C++ cxx::OOMusic (OOALMusic.h), for the resource manager, which makes musics by
[[OOMusic alloc] cxx_initWithContentsOfFile:], and the music controller, which messages them. Its
interface is the one OOALMusic.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly; like a converted
class's facade in a hierarchy (amendment oo-up4b item 3) it has no ivars, because the root's facade
holds its C++ part, and oo::ToObjC answers it for a cxx::OOMusic by the C++ class's name. Imported
as the last line of OOALMusic.h; do not import it directly. Never add to this file; converted code
does not message the facade.
