/*
OOShipGroup.h

A weak-referencing, mutable set of ships. Not thread safe.

C++20 since bead oo-bwrq (proposed ADR-0056). Its Objective-C facade was deleted by bead
oo-9ht.19 (batch F, ADR-0056 amendment oo-9ht.19): a group is its own PList::Object payload
(oo::PListForeign) and its own JS glue (OOJSPrivateObject); ships hold it as oo::Ref.
