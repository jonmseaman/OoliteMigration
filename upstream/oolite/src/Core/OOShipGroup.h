/*
OOShipGroup.h

A weak-referencing, mutable set of ships. Not thread safe.

C++20 since bead oo-bwrq (proposed ADR-0056). The class is cxx::OOShipGroup while
OOShipGroup+ObjCBridge.h, imported at the end of this header, keeps the Objective-C OOShipGroup
its unconverted callers message (ShipEntity, StationEntity, Universe, the JavaScript ShipGroup
binding, which keeps its category on the facade); the bridge's deletion bead moves it out of
namespace cxx.
