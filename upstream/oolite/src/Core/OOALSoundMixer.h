OOALSoundMixer.h

Class responsible for managing and mixing sound channels. This class is an
implementation detail. Do not use it directly; use an OOSoundSource to play an
OOSound.

C++20 since bead oo-6g4z (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en; a singleton:
amendment oo-r7m0). The class is cxx::OOSoundMixer while OOALSoundMixer+ObjCBridge.h, imported at
the end of this header, keeps the Objective-C OOSoundMixer that the sound sources, the root sound
and the OpenAL controller message; the bridge's deletion bead moves it out of namespace cxx.

OOALSound - OpenAL sound implementation for Oolite.
