OOShipGroup+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-bwrq): the Objective-C OOShipGroup, a facade over the
C++ cxx::OOShipGroup (OOShipGroup.h), for callers that are not converted yet. Its interface is the
one OOShipGroup.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same root, OOWeakRefObject; same
selectors and types), so those callers compile and behave unchanged; each method forwards to its
C++ member. Imported as the last line of OOShipGroup.h; do not import it directly.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  ----------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OOShipGroup * (this facade)     nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        oo::Ref<cxx::OOShipGroup>, cxx::OOShipGroup *
	  handing a group to Objective-C                                        oo::ToObjC(group)
	  taking one from Objective-C                                           oo::ToCxx(objcGroup)

The group's JavaScript wrapper is in the C++ group (cxx::OOShipGroup, bead oo-6symp.1);
the façade's -oo_jsValueInContext: and -oo_clearJSSelf: (OOShipGroup+ObjCBridge.mm) forward to it.
oo::ToObjC gives the group's one live facade (oo::ObjCPeers), so identity (and so the JavaScript
wrapper) survives a round trip. Never add to this file; converted code does not message the
facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once no file outside OOShipGroup.* names the Objective-C
OOShipGroup.
