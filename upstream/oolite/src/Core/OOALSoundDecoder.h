OOALSoundDecoder.h

Class responsible for converting a sound to a PCM buffer for playback. This
class is an implementation detail. Do not use it directly; use OOSound to
load sounds.

C++20 since bead oo-y0gz (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en). Bead oo-9ht.82
deleted its Objective-C facade and moved it to the global namespace: the sounds call it directly.
The Vorbis codec, the class cluster's one concrete decoder, is private to OOALSoundDecoder.mm.


OOALSound - OpenAL sound implementation for Oolite.
