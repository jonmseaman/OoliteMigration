/*

OOEnumerationShufflePRNG.h

The order-deciding core of the debug enumeration shuffle (OOEnumerationShuffle.h), as plain
C with no Objective-C and no dependency on the rest of Oolite.

It is a separate header for one reason: it is the part whose determinism has to be TESTED,
and a test that has to link GNUstep, SDL and SpiderMonkey to check a permutation is a test
nobody runs. tests/unit/test_enumeration_shuffle.c includes this file directly and compiles
in about a second. The Objective-C side then contains no order logic of its own, so the
thing under test is the thing that ships.

Do not use this for anything the game's behaviour depends on. It deliberately does NOT
touch RANROT: consuming numbers from the game's own generator would change gameplay in
exactly the runs this instrumentation is supposed to be observing, which would make every
finding suspect.
