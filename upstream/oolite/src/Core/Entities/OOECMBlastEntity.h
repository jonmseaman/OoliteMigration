OOECMBlastEntity.h

Invisible entity which radiates ECM blast energy.

C++20 since bead oo-ryhi, a leaf of the Entities seam (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-bj8 item
12). A global class over cxx::Entity, with no facade: nothing messages it by its own selectors.
ShipEntity's -fireECM makes it with initFromShip() and hands the universe the Entity facade
oo::NewEntityFacade makes, which is its Objective-C object from then on. The category of Entity
the header declared, -isECMBlast, which nothing sent, went with its bridge (bead oo-9ht.75): ask
the C++ part, dynamic_cast<OOECMBlastEntity *>(...)->isECMBlast().
