OOEntityWithDrawable+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-bj8): the Objective-C OOEntityWithDrawable, the
facade of a converted intermediate class (amendment oo-up4b item 2) over the C++
cxx::OOEntityWithDrawable (OOEntityWithDrawable.h). Its interface is the one
OOEntityWithDrawable.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly, and it has no ivars: the
root's _cxxEntity holds its C++ part. Its -init makes an Objective-C subclass's adapter over
cxx::OOEntityWithDrawable (oo::ObjCEntity<cxx::OOEntityWithDrawable>), so ShipEntity, SkyEntity
and OOVisualEffectEntity reach this class's members by [super ...] and the root's through it. The
OOSubEntity protocol the header declared is here, unchanged. Imported as the last line of
OOEntityWithDrawable.h; do not import it directly. Never add to this file. Deleted by its
deletion bead once the subclasses are C++.
