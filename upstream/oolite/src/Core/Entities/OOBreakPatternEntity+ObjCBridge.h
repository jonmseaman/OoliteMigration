OOBreakPatternEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8 and oo-a014): the Objective-C
OOBreakPatternEntity, the facade of a converted leaf entity over the C++ cxx::OOBreakPatternEntity
(OOBreakPatternEntity.h), kept because the universe makes the rings by its class method and sends
them its own selectors. Its interface is the one OOBreakPatternEntity.h declared before the
conversion, copied exactly, and it has no ivars: the root's _cxxEntity holds its C++ part. The
category of Entity the header declared is here too, unchanged; the facade overrides it, as the
class did. Imported as the last line of OOBreakPatternEntity.h; do not import it directly. Never
add to this file. Deleted by its deletion bead once the universe is C++.
