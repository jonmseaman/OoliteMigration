OOQuiriumCascadeEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8 and oo-2c6g): the category of the Objective-C
Entity that OOQuiriumCascadeEntity.h declared, unchanged; OOQuiriumCascadeEntity itself is C++
with no facade. Imported as the last line of OOQuiriumCascadeEntity.h; do not import it directly.
Never add to this file. Deleted with the Entity facade.
