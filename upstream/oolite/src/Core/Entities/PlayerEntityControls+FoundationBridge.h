PlayerEntityControls+FoundationBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0043, "Transitional bridges"; bead oo-3rb.214, chunk 1 of oo-3rb.77's
split). PlayerEntity (Controls)'s Foundation-typed API as it was before its sweep, with the same
selector names and types, forwarding to the cxx_ API in PlayerEntityControls.h. It exists so that
the callers in PlayerEntity.mm, PlayerEntityKeyMapper.mm and OOEquipmentType.mm compile unchanged;
each caller moves to the cxx_ API in its own sweep bead. When `git grep` finds no caller of
anything declared here, the bridge bead deletes this file, PlayerEntityControls+FoundationBridge.mm,
its line in Core/Entities/meson.build and the #import at the end of PlayerEntityControls.h. Never
add to it outside the PlayerEntityControls chunks; never call it from migrated code. oo-qps (the
removal of gnustep-base) cannot compile while it exists.

Registry: src/oofnd/README.md, "Transitional bridges".
