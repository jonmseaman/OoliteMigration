OOWaypointEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8 and oo-0mxi): the Objective-C
OOWaypointEntity, the facade of a converted leaf entity over the C++ cxx::OOWaypointEntity
(OOWaypointEntity.h), kept because the universe makes it (+waypointWithDictionary:) and keeps it
in its beacon list, and the universe, the HUD and the scripting binding message it by its own
selectors and as an OOBeaconEntity. Its interface is the one OOWaypointEntity.h declared before
the conversion, copied exactly, and it has no ivars: the root's _cxxEntity holds its C++ part. A
waypoint is made in C++, and oo::NewEntityFacade picks this class for it. Imported as the last
line of OOWaypointEntity.h; do not import it directly. Never add to this file. Deleted by its
deletion bead once its callers are C++.
