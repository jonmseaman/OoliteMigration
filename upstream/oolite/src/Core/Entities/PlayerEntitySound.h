/*	Foundation sweep (proposed ADR-0043, bead oo-14c5): weapon identifiers and sound keys are
	std::strings.

	Bead oo-xowh: the sound methods are members of cxx::PlayerEntity (PlayerEntity.h), defined in
	PlayerEntitySound.mm. The Objective-C selectors (-playIdentOn, -cxx_playShieldHit:weaponIdentifier:
	and the rest) are the facade's category (OOSound) in PlayerEntity+ObjCBridge.h. This header is
	kept so the files that import it keep compiling; it declares nothing.
