DustEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8 and oo-0mxi): the Objective-C DustEntity, the
facade of a converted leaf entity over the C++ cxx::DustEntity (DustEntity.h), kept because the
universe makes it ([[DustEntity alloc] init]), finds it by its class and sends it its own selector
(-setDustColor:). Its interface is the one DustEntity.h declared before the conversion, copied
exactly, and it has no ivars: the root's _cxxEntity holds its C++ part. It is also what the dust
shader's uniforms are bound to by selector (-warpVector, -offsetPlayerPosition) and the graphics
reset client, so it answers those too (DustEntity+ObjCBridge.mm). Imported as the last line of
DustEntity.h; do not import it directly. Never add to this file. Deleted by its deletion bead once
the universe is C++.
