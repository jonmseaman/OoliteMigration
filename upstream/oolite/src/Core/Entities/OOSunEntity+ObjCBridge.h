OOSunEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8 and oo-0mxi): the Objective-C OOSunEntity, the
facade of a converted leaf entity over the C++ cxx::OOSunEntity (OOSunEntity.h), kept because the
universe makes it ([[OOSunEntity alloc] initSunWithColor:andDictionary:]) and hands it out
(-[Universe sun]), and the universe, the player, the ships, the HUD, the collision regions, the
environment cube map and the scripting bindings message it by its own selectors and as an
OOStellarBody. Its interface is the one OOSunEntity.h declared before the conversion, copied
exactly, and it has no ivars: the root's _cxxEntity holds its C++ part. Imported as the last line
of OOSunEntity.h; do not import it directly. Never add to this file. Deleted by its deletion bead
once its callers are C++.
