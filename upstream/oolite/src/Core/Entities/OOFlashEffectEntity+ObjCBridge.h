OOFlashEffectEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8, oo-0otc and oo-0mxi): the Objective-C
OOFlashEffectEntity, the facade of a converted leaf entity over the C++ cxx::OOFlashEffectEntity
(OOFlashEffectEntity.h), kept because the ship and the universe send the class its own selectors
(+explosionFlashFromEntity:, +laserFlashWithPosition:velocity:color:, +setUpTexture), and because
the class is the graphics reset client of the flash texture. Its interface is the one
OOFlashEffectEntity.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly, and it has no ivars: the
root's _cxxEntity holds its C++ part. A flash is made in C++, and oo::NewEntityFacade picks this
class for it. Imported as the last line of OOFlashEffectEntity.h; do not import it directly. Never
add to this file. Deleted by its deletion bead once the ship and the universe are C++.
