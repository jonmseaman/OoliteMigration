	(ScriptMethods) is members of PlayerEntity, declared in PlayerEntity.h and defined in
	PlayerEntityScriptMethods.mm. Its Objective-C interface, for the callers that remain, is the
	category of the same name in PlayerEntity+ObjCBridge.h (deleted by bead oo-9ht.177), which PlayerEntity.h imported. This header

/*	OOGalacticCoordinatesFromInternal()
	Given internal coordinates ranging from 0 to 255 on each axis, return
	corresponding coordinates in user-meaningful coordinates by scaling by
	0.4 on the X axis and 0.2 on the Y axis.
	
	OOInternalCoordinatesFromGalactic()
	Inverse operation.
	
	For valid floating-point comparisons, it is imperative that the same
	calculation be used consistently.
