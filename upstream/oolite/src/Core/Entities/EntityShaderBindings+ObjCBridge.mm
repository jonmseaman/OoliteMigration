EntityShaderBindings+ObjCBridge.mm

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-9fwb): the category Entity (ShaderBindings), whose
methods the shader uniforms find by selector on an entity's Objective-C object (the names and
types are whitelisted in shader-uniform-bindings.plist). Each method forwards to its member of
cxx::Entity (EntityShaderBindings.mm). Deleted with the Entity facade (its deletion bead), when
the uniforms bind C++ members.
