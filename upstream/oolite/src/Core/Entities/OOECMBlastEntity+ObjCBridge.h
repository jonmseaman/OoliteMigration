OOECMBlastEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-bj8 item 12): the category of the Objective-C Entity
that OOECMBlastEntity.h declared, moved here when the class became C++ (bead oo-ryhi), unchanged.
Imported as the last line of OOECMBlastEntity.h; do not import it directly. Deleted by its
deletion bead.
