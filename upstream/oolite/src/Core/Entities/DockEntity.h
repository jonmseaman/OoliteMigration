DockEntity.h

ShipEntity subclass representing a dock.

C++ since its slice plan (docs/phases/3-slices/DockEntity.md; proposed ADR-0056, amendments
oo-60fwo, oo-64ako and oo-ao2d). Bead oo-9ht.180 deleted its Objective-C facade (amendment
oo-9ht.180): a dock is made in C++ by DockEntity::newDockObject() and its Objective-C object was the
ship's facade, which answered the dock's selectors the game can still find by name for a dock's
C++ part only; since bead oo-9ht.144 (amendment oo-9ht.144) the object is OOEntityWithDrawable's
facade and the root's facade answers them.
