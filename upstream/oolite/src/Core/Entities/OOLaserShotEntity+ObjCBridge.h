OOLaserShotEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8 and oo-5zpq): the Objective-C OOLaserShotEntity,
the facade of a converted leaf entity over the C++ cxx::OOLaserShotEntity (OOLaserShotEntity.h),
kept because ShipEntity makes shots by its class method and messages them, and PlayerEntity keeps
its last shots by this type. Its interface is the one OOLaserShotEntity.h declared before the
conversion, copied exactly, and it has no ivars: the root's _cxxEntity holds its C++ part. Its class
is the graphics reset client of the shot textures. Imported as the last line of
OOLaserShotEntity.h; do not import it directly. Never add to this file. Deleted by its deletion
bead once ShipEntity and PlayerEntity are C++.
