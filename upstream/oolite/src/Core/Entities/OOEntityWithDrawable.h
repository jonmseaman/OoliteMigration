OOEntityWithDrawable.h

Abstract intermediate class for entities which use an OODrawable to render.

C++20 since bead oo-bj8, with Entity the Entities pattern seam (proposed ADR-0056, amendment
oo-bj8). The class is cxx::OOEntityWithDrawable while OOEntityWithDrawable+ObjCBridge.h, imported
at the end of this header, keeps the Objective-C OOEntityWithDrawable that its unconverted
subclasses (ShipEntity, SkyEntity, OOVisualEffectEntity) derive from; the bridge's deletion bead
moves it out of namespace cxx.
