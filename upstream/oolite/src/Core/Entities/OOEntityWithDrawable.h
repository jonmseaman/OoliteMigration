OOEntityWithDrawable.h

Abstract intermediate class for entities which use an OODrawable to render.

C++20 since bead oo-bj8, with Entity the Entities pattern seam (proposed ADR-0056, amendment
oo-bj8). The global C++ class since bead oo-9ht.40 deleted its Objective-C facade
(OOEntityWithDrawable+ObjCBridge): the object of a ship, a sky or a visual effect is the root's
facade (ADR-0056 amendment oo-9ht.40).
