OORingEffectEntity.h

Entity subclass for expanding-ring effect, used for hyperspace entry and for
some large explosions.
C++20 since bead oo-peql, a leaf of the Entities seam (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-bj8 item
12). A global class over cxx::Entity, with no facade: nothing messages it by its own selectors.
Its callers (ShipEntity, Universe) make it with a factory and hand the universe the Entity facade
oo::NewEntityFacade makes, which is its Objective-C object from then on.
