ShipEntity+ObjCBridge.mm

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8 and oo-60fwo): the Objective-C ShipEntity
facade (see ShipEntity+ObjCBridge.h). Its initialisers and -dealloc are here, in a category while
the class's @implementation is still ShipEntity.mm, because they need the Objective-C object as
self (amendment oo-bj8 items 6 and 7), and so are the two SubEntityRelationship categories (item
12); the other methods are still in ShipEntity.mm until their slices move them. Deleted with
ShipEntity+ObjCBridge.h.
