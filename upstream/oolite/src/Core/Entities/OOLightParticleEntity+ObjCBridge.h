OOLightParticleEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8 and oo-0otc): the Objective-C
OOLightParticleEntity, the facade of a converted intermediate class (amendment oo-up4b item 2) over
the C++ cxx::OOLightParticleEntity (OOLightParticleEntity.h). Its interface is the one
OOLightParticleEntity.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly, and it has no ivars: the
root's _cxxEntity holds its C++ part. Its -init makes an Objective-C subclass's adapter over
cxx::OOLightParticleEntity, so OOFlashEffectEntity, OOFlasherEntity and OOPlasmaShotEntity reach
this class's members by [super ...], and the C++ bodies reach their -texture and
-drawSubEntityImmediate:translucent: overrides. They read the ivars that were @protected through
the typed crossing below, oo::ToCxx(self)->_colorComponents. A converted subclass (OOSparkEntity,
OOPlasmaBurstEntity) gets this class as its facade from oo::NewEntityFacade. Its class is the
graphics reset client of the default texture. Imported as the last line of OOLightParticleEntity.h;
do not import it directly. Never add to this file. Deleted by its deletion bead once the
subclasses and callers are C++.
