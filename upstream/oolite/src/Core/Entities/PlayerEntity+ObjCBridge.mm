PlayerEntity+ObjCBridge.mm

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8, oo-60fwo and oo-jx5np): the Objective-C
PlayerEntity facade (see PlayerEntity+ObjCBridge.h). The shared player, its initialisers and
-dealloc are here, in a category while the class's @implementation is still PlayerEntity.mm,
because they need the Objective-C object as self (amendment oo-bj8 item 7), as is the override of
the ship's -initShipPart that makes the player's part (amendment oo-64ako item 2); the other methods are
still in PlayerEntity.mm and its category files until their slices move them. Deleted with
PlayerEntity+ObjCBridge.h.

/*	Nasty initialization mechanism:
	PlayerEntity is alloced and inited on demand by +sharedPlayer. This
	initialization doesn't actually set anything up -- apart from the
	assertion, it's like doing a bare alloc. -deferredInit does the work
	that -init "should" be doing. It assumes that -[ShipEntity cxx_initWithKey:
	definition:] will not return an object other than self.
	This is necessary because we need a pointer to the PlayerEntity early in
	startup, when ship data hasn't been loaded yet. In particular, we need
	a pointer to the player to set up the JavaScript environment, we need the
	JavaScript environment to set up OpenGL, and we need OpenGL set up to load
	ships.
