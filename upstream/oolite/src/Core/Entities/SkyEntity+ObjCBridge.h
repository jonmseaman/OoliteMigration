SkyEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8 and oo-0mxi): the Objective-C SkyEntity, the
facade of a converted leaf entity over the C++ cxx::SkyEntity (SkyEntity.h), kept because the
universe makes it ([[SkyEntity alloc] initWithColors::andSystemInfo:]), finds it by its class and
sends it its own selectors (-skyColor, -changeProperty:withDictionary:). Its interface is the one
SkyEntity.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly, and it has no ivars: the root's
_cxxEntity holds its C++ part. Imported as the last line of SkyEntity.h; do not import it
directly. Never add to this file. Deleted by its deletion bead once the universe and the
environment cube map are C++.
