WormholeEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8 and oo-0mxi): the Objective-C WormholeEntity,
the facade of a converted leaf entity over the C++ cxx::WormholeEntity (WormholeEntity.h), kept
because the player and the ships make it ([[WormholeEntity alloc] initWormholeTo:fromShip:],
-initWithDict:) and keep it, and the player, the ships, the universe, the HUD, the debug monitor
and the scripting bindings message it by its own selectors. Its interface is the one
WormholeEntity.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly, and it has no ivars: the root's
_cxxEntity holds its C++ part. Imported as the last line of WormholeEntity.h; do not import it
directly. Never add to this file. Deleted by its deletion bead once its callers are C++.
