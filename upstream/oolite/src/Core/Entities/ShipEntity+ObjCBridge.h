/*

ShipEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8 and oo-60fwo): the Objective-C ShipEntity, the
facade over the C++ cxx::ShipEntity (ShipEntity.h) while the class converts slice by slice
(docs/phases/3-slices/ShipEntity.md). Its interface is the one ShipEntity.h declared before slice 1,
copied exactly, with ShipEntity (Debug) and the category Entity (SubEntityRelationship), which the
header declared after it; only -cxx_initWithKey:definition: moved, to the category that implements
it beside -init and -dealloc. Its methods keep their Objective-C bodies until their slice moves them
to cxx::ShipEntity and leaves a forwarder here. It has one ivar, _cxxShip: the root's _cxxEntity,
typed, borrowed (the root owns the part), set by the initialiser; unconverted code reads the ship's
members through it by their old names (_cxxShip->fuel, ship->_cxxShip->fuel). Its initialisers make
an Objective-C ship's adapter over cxx::ShipEntity (ObjCShipEntity in the .mm), so
StationEntity, DockEntity, PlayerEntity and ProxyPlayerEntity reach the ship's members through it.
Imported as the last line of ShipEntity.h; do not import it directly. Never add to this file.
Deleted by its deletion bead once every slice, the categories and the subclasses are C++.
