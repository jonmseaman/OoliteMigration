OOExhaustPlumeEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8, oo-0mxi and oo-2c6g): the Objective-C
OOExhaustPlumeEntity, the facade of a converted leaf entity over the C++
cxx::OOExhaustPlumeEntity (OOExhaustPlumeEntity.h), kept because the ships make it
(+exhaustForShip:withDefinition:andScale:) and message it (-resetPlume, OOSubEntity), and the
scripting binding finds it by its class and sends it its own selectors; the class is also the
graphics reset client of the plume texture. Its interface is the one OOExhaustPlumeEntity.h
declared before the conversion, copied exactly, and it has no ivars: the root's _cxxEntity holds
its C++ part. A plume is made in C++, and oo::NewEntityFacade picks this class for it. The
header's category of Entity, -isExhaust, is here too (amendment oo-2c6g item 1): it answers from
the C++ part. Imported as the last line of OOExhaustPlumeEntity.h; do not import it directly.
Never add to this file. Deleted by its deletion bead once its callers are C++.
