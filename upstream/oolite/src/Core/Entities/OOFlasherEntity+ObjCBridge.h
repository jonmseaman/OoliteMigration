OOFlasherEntity+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-bj8, oo-0otc, oo-0mxi and oo-2c6g): the
Objective-C OOFlasherEntity, the facade of a converted leaf entity over the C++
cxx::OOFlasherEntity (OOFlasherEntity.h), kept because the ships and the visual effects make it
(+flasherWithDictionary:) and message it as a subentity (-setActive:, OOSubEntity), and the
scripting binding finds it by its class and sends it its own selectors. Its interface is the one
OOFlasherEntity.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly, and it has no ivars: the root's
_cxxEntity holds its C++ part. A flasher is made in C++, and oo::NewEntityFacade picks this class
for it. The header's category of Entity, -isFlasher, is here too (amendment oo-2c6g item 1): it
answers from the C++ part. Imported as the last line of OOFlasherEntity.h; do not import it
directly. Never add to this file. Deleted by its deletion bead once its callers are C++.
