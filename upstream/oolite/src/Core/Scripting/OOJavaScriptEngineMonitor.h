OOJavaScriptEngineMonitor.h

The JavaScript engine's debugging "monitor": the object the engine gives its errors, warnings and
log messages to (in Oolite, the debug monitor). It was the Objective-C protocol
OOJavaScriptEngineMonitor, adopted by the debug monitor's facade and sent after
-respondsToSelector:; it is a C++ interface since bead oo-9ht.74.1 (proposed ADR-0056, amendment
oo-9ht.74.1), with the same two messages as members. The engine borrows its monitor (the debug
monitor lives as long as the process; a caller keeps its monitor alive while it is set).
