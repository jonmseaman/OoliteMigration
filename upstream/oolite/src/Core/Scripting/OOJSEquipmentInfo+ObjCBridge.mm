OOJSEquipmentInfo+ObjCBridge.mm

The Objective-C left over from OOJSEquipmentInfo.mm (bead oo-supk; proposed ADR-0056 amendments
oo-ppc, oo-ykoy, oo-bwrq and oo-6ia4 item 3): OOEquipmentType (OOJavaScriptExtensions), the
category through which the engine asks an equipment type's façade for its JS object and class name
by selector, and tells it that object is gone. Its methods stay methods of the façade, each
forwarding in one line to the C++ function in OOJSEquipmentInfo.mm that holds its old body, with
the façade's _jsSelf ivar, the type's JS object, passed by reference. Deleted by oo-9ht.102, once
the engine's object wrappers hold C++ objects (amendment oo-ppc, item 5) and the JS object lives in
the C++ equipment type; the façade's own deletion (oo-9ht.28) waits for it.
