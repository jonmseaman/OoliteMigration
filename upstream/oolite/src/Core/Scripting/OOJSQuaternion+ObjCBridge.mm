OOJSQuaternion+ObjCBridge.mm

The Objective-C left over from OOJSQuaternion.mm (bead oo-hwae, converted the way bead oo-ppc
converted OOJSVector; proposed ADR-0056 amendment oo-ppc): PlayerEntity (JSQuaternionStatistics),
a debug-build category on a class that is still Objective-C. The debug console calls its methods
by selector name (PS.callObjC("reportJSQuaternionStatistics")), so they stay methods of
PlayerEntity, each forwarding in one line to the C++ function that holds its old body. Deleted
when PlayerEntity converts (bead oo-9ht.15, with OOJSVector's): the two methods then become
members of the C++ PlayerEntity that call the same functions, reached by callObjC's name table.
