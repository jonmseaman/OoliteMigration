OOPListScript+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-q9q4): the Objective-C OOPListScript, a subclass of the
Objective-C OOScript, over the C++ cxx::OOPListScript (OOPListScript.h). A class whose superclass
is still Objective-C (amendment oo-o89): the facade keeps the old superclass, makes and owns the
C++ object in its initialiser, and forwards the OOScript overrides, which OOScript and its callers
send. Its interface is the one OOPListScript.h declared before the conversion; the initialiser,
which the file's private category declared, is in category OOObjCBridge for cxx::OOPListScript's
factories. Imported as the last line of OOPListScript.h; do not import it directly.

	converted (C++)                        oo::ObjCRef<OOScript *>, as the superclass is Objective-C
	  the C++ object of a facade                                            oo::ToCxx(objcScript)
	  the facade of a C++ object                                            oo::ToObjC(script): live or nil

oo::ToObjC never makes a facade: a new one would have fresh OOScript state (amendment oo-o89
item 2). Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade except to make one.
Deleted by its deletion bead once OOScript is C++.
