OOJSSound+ObjCBridge.mm

The Objective-C left over from OOJSSound.mm (bead oo-crq2; proposed ADR-0056 amendments oo-ppc and
oo-ykoy): OOSound (OOJavaScriptExtentions), the category through which the engine asks a OOSound
for its JS side by selector. Its methods stay methods of OOSound, each forwarding in one line to
the C++ function in OOJSSound.mm that holds its old body, and its @interface, which OOJSSound.h
declared, is here with them. Deleted when OOSound converts (oo-w5tu): the methods then become
members of the C++ OOSound that call the same functions.
