OOJSPopulatorDefinition.h

C++20 since bead oo-1h0h (proposed ADR-0056, the OOColor house style). Its superclass,
OOWeakRefObject, is still Objective-C (the weak-reference support that OOWeakReference+ObjCBridge
keeps), so the class is cxx::OOJSPopulatorDefinition holding only its own ivars and methods, and
OOJSPopulatorDefinition+ObjCBridge.h, imported at the end of this header, keeps the Objective-C
OOJSPopulatorDefinition : OOWeakRefObject that OOJSSystem makes and Universe keeps and messages
(ADR-0056 amendment oo-o89). The bridge's deletion bead waits for OOWeakRefObject's retirement.
