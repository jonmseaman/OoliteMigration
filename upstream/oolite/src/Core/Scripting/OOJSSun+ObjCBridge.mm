OOJSSun+ObjCBridge.mm

The Objective-C left over from OOJSSun.mm (bead oo-hgfh; proposed ADR-0056 amendments oo-ppc and
oo-ykoy): OOSunEntity (OOJavaScriptExtensions), the category through which the engine asks a
OOSunEntity for its JS side by selector. Its methods stay methods of OOSunEntity, each forwarding
in one line to the C++ function in OOJSSun.mm that holds its old body, and its @interface, which
OOJSSun.h declared, is here with them. Deleted when OOSunEntity converts (oo-ubjo): the methods
then become members of the C++ OOSunEntity that call the same functions.
