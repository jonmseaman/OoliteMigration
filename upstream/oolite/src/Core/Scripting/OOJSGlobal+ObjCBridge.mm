OOJSGlobal+ObjCBridge.mm

The Objective-C left over from OOJSGlobal.mm (bead oo-3dj2; proposed ADR-0056 amendments oo-9ht.66
and oo-6ia4 item 6): OOJavaScriptEngine (OOMonitorSupportInternal), the category interface that
OOJSGlobal.mm declared to type its one send of -sendMonitorLogMessage:withMessageClass:inContext:
(the engine implements it in OOJavaScriptEngine.mm), moved here verbatim with that send, as
OOJSGlobalSendMonitorLogMessage(). Deleted when the engine converts (oo-k4nu) or declares the
method in its header: log() then calls the engine directly.
