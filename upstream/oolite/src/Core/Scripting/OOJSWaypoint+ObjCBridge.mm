OOJSWaypoint+ObjCBridge.mm

The Objective-C left over from OOJSWaypoint.mm (bead oo-mae5; proposed ADR-0056 amendments oo-ppc
and oo-ykoy): OOWaypointEntity (OOJavaScriptExtensions), the category through which the engine asks
a OOWaypointEntity for its JS side by selector. Its methods stay methods of OOWaypointEntity, each
forwarding in one line to the C++ function in OOJSWaypoint.mm that holds its old body, and its
@interface, which OOJSWaypoint.h declared, is here with them. Deleted when OOWaypointEntity
converts (oo-zsid): the methods then become members of the C++ OOWaypointEntity that call the same
functions.
