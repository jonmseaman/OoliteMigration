OOJSTimer+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-kdyh): the Objective-C OOJSTimer, the facade of a
cxx::OOJSTimer (OOJSTimer.h). Nothing outside OOJSTimer.mm names the class, but a Timer's JS
private slot holds this facade retained (amendment oo-ppc item 5), the engine sends it the JS glue
selectors (-oo_jsValueInContext:, -cxx_oo_jsClassName), and the timer queue holds it. It is a
subclass of the OOScriptTimer facade with no ivars, which forwards through oo::ToCxx(self)
(amendment oo-up4b item 3); oo::ToObjC of a cxx::OOJSTimer picks it by name. Imported as the
last line of OOJSTimer.h; do not import it directly. Deleted by its deletion bead once the
engine's object wrappers hold C++ objects (amendment oo-ppc item 5) and the timer queue holds C++
timers.
