OOJSCall+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-81hy): the Objective-C that OOJSCallObjCObjectMethod()
(OOJSCall.mm) needs to read and call Objective-C methods by name, moved out of OOJSCall.mm
unchanged (amendment oo-rmd7 item 1): the template class whose methods' type encodings the call
matches a method's signature against (it exists to be read by the Objective-C runtime), and the
-boolValue/-intValue protocol a "_bool" method's object result is asked through. Imported as the
last line of OOJSCall.h; do not import it directly. Deleted by its deletion bead once no
Objective-C class is left to call by name.
