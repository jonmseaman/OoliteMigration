OOJSSoundSource+ObjCBridge.mm

The Objective-C left over from OOJSSoundSource.mm (bead oo-cib0; proposed ADR-0056 amendments oo-
ppc and oo-ykoy): OOSoundSource (OOJavaScriptExtentions), the category through which the engine
asks a OOSoundSource for its JS side by selector. Its methods stay methods of OOSoundSource, each
forwarding in one line to the C++ function in OOJSSoundSource.mm that holds its old body, and its
@interface, which OOJSSoundSource.h declared, is here with them. Deleted when OOSoundSource
converts (oo-zoj3): the methods then become members of the C++ OOSoundSource that call the same
functions.
