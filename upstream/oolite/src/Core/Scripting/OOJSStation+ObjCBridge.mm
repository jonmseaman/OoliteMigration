OOJSStation+ObjCBridge.mm

The Objective-C left over from OOJSStation.mm (bead oo-3oxq; proposed ADR-0056 amendments oo-ppc
and oo-ykoy): StationEntity (OOJavaScriptExtensions), the category through which the engine asks a
StationEntity for its JS side by selector. Its methods stay methods of StationEntity, each
forwarding in one line to the C++ function in OOJSStation.mm that holds its old body. Deleted when
StationEntity converts (oo-tqem7): the methods then become members of the C++ StationEntity that
call the same functions.
