OOJSSystemInfo+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-6ia4): the Objective-C OOSystemInfo, the facade of a
cxx::OOSystemInfo (OOJSSystemInfo.h). Nothing outside OOJSSystemInfo.mm names the class, but a
SystemInfo's JS private slot holds this facade retained (amendment oo-ppc item 5), and the engine
sends it the JS glue selectors (-oo_jsValueInContext:, -cxx_oo_jsClassName) and asks for its
description. Its interface is the one OOJSSystemInfo.mm declared before the conversion, copied
exactly (same root, OOObject; same selectors and types); each method forwards to its C++ member.
Imported as the last line of OOJSSystemInfo.h; do not import it directly. Deleted by its deletion
bead once the engine's object wrappers hold C++ objects (amendment oo-ppc item 5).
