OOScript+FoundationBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0043, "Transitional bridges"; bead oo-du83). OOScript's Foundation-typed
class API as it was before its sweep, with the same selector names and types, forwarding to the
cxx_ API in OOScript.h. It exists so that OOScript's callers compile unchanged; each caller moves to
the cxx_ API in its own sweep bead. When `git grep` finds no caller of anything declared here, the
bridge bead deletes this file, OOScript+FoundationBridge.mm, its line in Core/Scripting/meson.build
and the #import at the end of OOScript.h. Never add to it; never call it from migrated code. oo-qps
(the removal of gnustep-base) cannot compile while it exists.

Registry: src/oofnd/README.md, "Transitional bridges".
