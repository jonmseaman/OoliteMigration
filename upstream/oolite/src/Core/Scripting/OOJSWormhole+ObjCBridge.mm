OOJSWormhole+ObjCBridge.mm

The Objective-C left over from OOJSWormhole.mm (bead oo-ykoy; proposed ADR-0056 amendments oo-ppc
and oo-ykoy): WormholeEntity (OOJavaScriptExtensions), the category through which the engine asks a
WormholeEntity for its JS side by selector. Its methods stay methods of WormholeEntity, each
forwarding in one line to the C++ function in OOJSWormhole.mm that holds its old body, and its
@interface, which OOJSWormhole.h declared, is here with them. Deleted when WormholeEntity converts
(oo-z55j): the methods then become members of the C++ WormholeEntity that call the same functions.
