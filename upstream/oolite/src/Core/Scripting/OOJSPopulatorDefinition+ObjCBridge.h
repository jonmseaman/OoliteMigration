OOJSPopulatorDefinition+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-1h0h): the Objective-C OOJSPopulatorDefinition, a
subclass of the Objective-C OOWeakRefObject, over the C++ cxx::OOJSPopulatorDefinition
(OOJSPopulatorDefinition.h). A class whose superclass is still Objective-C (amendment oo-o89): the
facade keeps the old superclass, so it is still weakly referenced as before (-weakRetain), makes
and owns the C++ object in -init, and forwards every method. Its interface is the one
OOJSPopulatorDefinition.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors and
types; the ivar is the C++ object). Imported as the last line of OOJSPopulatorDefinition.h; do
not import it directly.

	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  -------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OOJSPopulatorDefinition *       nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        the facade (it carries the weak-reference state)
	  the C++ object of a facade                                            oo::ToCxx(objcDefinition)
	  the facade of a C++ object                                            oo::ToObjC(definition): live or nil

oo::ToObjC never makes a facade (amendment oo-o89 item 2). Never add to this file; converted code
does not message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once its holders (Universe and OOJSSystem) are C++
and hold it with oo::WeakRef; OOWeakRefObject goes after that (bead oo-9ht.22).
