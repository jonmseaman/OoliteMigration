OOJSEntityHolder.h

What an entity's JS object holds in its private slot (bead oo-9ht.39.3, proposed ADR-0056 amendment
oo-9ht.39.3, which applies amendment oo-6symp to the entities): a weak reference to the C++
entity. The slot held the root facade's weak reference (-weakRetain) until then, so the JS object
did not keep the entity alive and read as a stale reference (nil) once it had gone; the holder
does the same with oo::WeakRef. The slot retains the holder (OOJSSetCxxPrivate) and the finalizer
releases it (OOJSCxxObjectWrapperFinalize). EntityJSValueInContext() makes one per JS object.

Include it after cxx::Entity's definition (Entity.h; a test's stand-in): oo::WeakRef needs the
complete class. The JS glue members are defined in OOJSEntity.mm (a narrow test that links a
binding without it defines them as stand-ins).
