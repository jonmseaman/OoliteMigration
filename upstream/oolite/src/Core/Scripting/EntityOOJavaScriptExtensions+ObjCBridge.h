EntityOOJavaScriptExtensions+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-ppc and oo-ykoy): the categories' @interfaces that
EntityOOJavaScriptExtensions.h declared, copied exactly, for the engine, the bindings and the
entities that send their selectors (isVisibleToScripts, getJSClass:andPrototype:, deleteJSSelf,
subEntitiesForScript, setTargetForScript:; PlayerEntity's setJSSelf:context: went with the player's
facade, bead oo-9ht.177: OOJSPlayerShipSetJSSelf() is its body). Imported as the last line of EntityOOJavaScriptExtensions.h; do not
import it directly. Deleted by its deletion bead once Entity, ShipEntity and PlayerEntity are C++.
