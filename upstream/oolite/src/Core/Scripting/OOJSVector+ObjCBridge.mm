OOJSVector+ObjCBridge.mm

The Objective-C left over from OOJSVector.mm (bead oo-ppc, proposed ADR-0056 amendment oo-ppc):
PlayerEntity (JSVectorStatistics), a debug-build category on a class that is still Objective-C.
The debug console calls its methods by selector name (PS.callObjC("reportJSVectorStatistics")),
so they stay methods of PlayerEntity, each forwarding in one line to the C++ function that holds
its old body. Deleted when PlayerEntity converts: the two methods then become members of the C++
PlayerEntity that call the same functions, reached by callObjC's name table.
