OOJSCall.h

Basic JavaScript-to-ObjC bridge implementation.

Converted in bead oo-81hy (proposed ADR-0056 amendment oo-ppc; no class of its own): bool for BOOL.
Since bead oo-9ht.44 an entity is called through its generated name table (OOJSCallEntityMethods.h)
and the signature templates of any other object are @encode() strings: no Objective-C class or
protocol of its own is left (the bridge files are deleted).

/*	OOJSCallObjCObjectMethod()
	
	Function for implementing JavaScript call() methods.
	
	The argument list is expected to be either a single string (selector), or
	a string ending with a : followed by arbitrary arguments which will be
	concatenated as a string. (This behaviour reflects Oolite's traditional
	scripting system and the expectations of its script methods. It also has
	the advantage that it needs only the runtime's method type encodings, not
	a general method-signature parser.)
	
	If the method returns an object, *outResult will be set to that object's
	-oo_jsValueInContext:. Otherwise, it will be left unchanged.
	
	argv is assumed to contain at least one value.

	(its object's per-part -respondsToSelector:) is called, with the table's signature; any other
