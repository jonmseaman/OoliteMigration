OOScriptTimer+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-kdyh): the Objective-C OOScriptTimer, a facade over the
C++ cxx::OOScriptTimer (OOScriptTimer.h), for what is not converted yet: PlayerEntity, which
sends +updateTimers and +noteGameReset, and OOPriorityQueue, whose elements are Objective-C
objects ordered by a selector (-compareByNextFireTime:), so a scheduled timer is queued as its
facade. Its interface is the one OOScriptTimer.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly
(same selectors and types; the ivar is the C++ object). Imported as the last line of
OOScriptTimer.h; do not import it directly.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  -------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OOScriptTimer *                 nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        oo::Ref<cxx::OOScriptTimer>
	  handing a timer to Objective-C                                        oo::ToObjC(timer)
	  taking one from Objective-C                                           oo::ToCxx(objcTimer)

oo::ToObjC gives a timer's one live facade (oo::ObjCPeers), always an OOScriptTimer, so identity
survives and the queue finds the facade it holds. No Objective-C subclass of OOScriptTimer is left:
the OOJSTimer facade's JS glue (-oo_jsValueInContext:, -cxx_oo_jsClassName) is answered here for a
timer whose C++ part has it, and the description names the C++ class (className()), as the
subclass's facade printed (ADR-0056 amendment oo-9ht.37). A new subclass would need the adapter of
ADR-0056 amendment 1. Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once
PlayerEntity is converted and the timer queue holds C++ timers.
