OOPListScript.h

Property list-based script.

I started off reimplementing plist scripting here, in order to remove one of
PlayerEntity's many overloaded functions. The scale of the task was such that
I've stepped back, and this simply wraps the old plist scripting in
PlayerEntity.

C++20 since bead oo-q9q4 (proposed ADR-0056, the OOColor house style). Its superclass, OOScript,
is still Objective-C, so the class is cxx::OOPListScript holding only its own ivars and methods,
and OOPListScript+ObjCBridge.h, imported at the end of this header, keeps the Objective-C
OOPListScript : OOScript that makes and owns it (ADR-0056 amendment oo-o89). The bridge's
deletion bead waits for OOScript's conversion.
