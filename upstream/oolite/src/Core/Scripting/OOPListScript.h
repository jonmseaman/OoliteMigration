OOPListScript.h

Property list-based script.

I started off reimplementing plist scripting here, in order to remove one of
PlayerEntity's many overloaded functions. The scale of the task was such that
I've stepped back, and this simply wraps the old plist scripting in
PlayerEntity.

C++20 since bead oo-q9q4 (proposed ADR-0056, the OOColor house style). Bead oo-9ht.57 deleted its
Objective-C facade once OOScript was C++ (oo-604l; ADR-0056 amendments oo-o89 item 3 and "deleting
a facade"): the class is global and derives from cxx::OOScript, overriding its members, and
Objective-C sees a plist script as the root's facade, an OOScript.
