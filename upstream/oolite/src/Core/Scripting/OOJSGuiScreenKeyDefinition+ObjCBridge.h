OOJSGuiScreenKeyDefinition+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-xg7g): the Objective-C OOJSGuiScreenKeyDefinition, a
subclass of the Objective-C OOWeakRefObject, over the C++ cxx::OOJSGuiScreenKeyDefinition
(OOJSGuiScreenKeyDefinition.h). A class whose superclass is still Objective-C (amendment oo-o89): the
facade keeps the old superclass, so it is still weakly referenced as before (-weakRetain), makes
and owns the C++ object in -init, and forwards every method. Its interface is the one
OOJSGuiScreenKeyDefinition.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors and
types; the ivar is the C++ object). Imported as the last line of OOJSGuiScreenKeyDefinition.h; do
not import it directly.

	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  -------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OOJSGuiScreenKeyDefinition *       nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        the facade (it carries the weak-reference state)
	  the C++ object of a facade                                            oo::ToCxx(objcDefinition)
	  the facade of a C++ object                                            oo::ToObjC(definition): live or nil

oo::ToObjC never makes a facade (amendment oo-o89 item 2). Never add to this file; converted code
does not message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once its holders (PlayerEntity and OOJSGlobal) are C++
and hold it with oo::WeakRef; OOWeakRefObject goes after that (bead oo-9ht.22).
