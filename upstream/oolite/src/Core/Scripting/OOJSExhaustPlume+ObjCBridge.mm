OOJSExhaustPlume+ObjCBridge.mm

The Objective-C left over from OOJSExhaustPlume.mm (bead oo-utlm; proposed ADR-0056 amendments oo-
ppc and oo-ykoy): OOExhaustPlumeEntity (OOJavaScriptExtensions), the category through which the
engine asks a OOExhaustPlumeEntity for its JS side by selector. Its methods stay methods of
OOExhaustPlumeEntity, each forwarding in one line to the C++ function in OOJSExhaustPlume.mm that
holds its old body, and its @interface, which OOJSExhaustPlume.h declared, is here with them.
Deleted when OOExhaustPlumeEntity converts (oo-y86f): the methods then become members of the C++
OOExhaustPlumeEntity that call the same functions.
