OOJSEngineNativeWrappers.mm

The handler behind OOJS_NATIVE_EXIT (OOJSEngineNativeWrappers.h). Bead oo-ppc, the Phase 3
scripting-bindings pattern (proposed ADR-0056 amendment oo-ppc), made the macro a C++
catch (...); this file is the one place that tells an Objective-C exception from a C++ one, so the
binding files need neither. OOJSReportWrappedException() moved here from OOJavaScriptEngine.mm
unchanged. Objective-C++ until nothing can raise an Objective-C exception (Phase 4).
