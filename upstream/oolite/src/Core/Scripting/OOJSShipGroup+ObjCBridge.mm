OOJSShipGroup+ObjCBridge.mm

The Objective-C left over from OOJSShipGroup.mm (bead oo-n64m; proposed ADR-0056 amendments oo-ppc,
oo-ykoy and oo-bwrq): OOShipGroup (OOJavaScriptExtensions), the category through which the engine
asks a group's façade for its JS object by selector, and tells it that object is gone. Its methods
stay methods of the façade, each forwarding in one line to the C++ function in OOJSShipGroup.mm
that holds its old body, with the façade's _jsSelf ivar, the group's JS object, passed by
reference. Deleted with the façade (oo-9ht.19), once the engine's object wrappers hold C++ objects
(amendment oo-ppc, item 5) and the JS object lives in the C++ group.
