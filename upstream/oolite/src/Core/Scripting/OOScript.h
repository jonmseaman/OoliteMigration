OOScript.h

Abstract base class for scripts.
Currently, Oolite supports two types of script: the original property list
scripts and JavaScript scripts. OOS, a format that translated into plist
scripts, was supported until 1.69.1, but never used. OOScript unifies the
interfaces to the script types and abstracts loading. Additionally, it falls
back to a more "primitive" script if loading of one type fails; specifically,
the order of precedence is:
	script.js		(JavaScript)
//	script.oos		(OOS)
	script.plist	(property list)
