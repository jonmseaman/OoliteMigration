OOScript.h

Abstract base class for scripts.
Currently, Oolite supports two types of script: the original property list
scripts and JavaScript scripts. OOS, a format that translated into plist
scripts, was supported until 1.69.1, but never used. OOScript unifies the
interfaces to the script types and abstracts loading. Additionally, it falls
back to a more "primitive" script if loading of one type fails; specifically,
the order of precedence is:
	script.js		(JavaScript)
//	script.oos		(OOS)
	script.plist	(property list)

C++20 since bead oo-604l (proposed ADR-0056, Amendment 1 of bead oo-cwz: a hierarchy root, as
amendment oo-6bux's OOJoystickManager). The script is cxx::OOScript. Its subclasses are still
Objective-C (OOJSScript) or a facade that subclasses the Objective-C root (OOPListScript, amendment
oo-o89), as are the callers, so the Objective-C OOScript in OOScript+ObjCBridge.h (imported at the
end of this header) is both their facade and the subclasses' superclass. The methods a subclass
overrides (name, scriptDescription, version, requiresTickle, runWithTarget, and the description's
components) are virtual; an Objective-C subclass's C++ part is an adapter whose overrides message
it. The class methods that load scripts are static members; they still make the subclasses'
Objective-C objects, which they answer as the root's facade.
