OOJSPlayerShip.h

JavaScript proxy for the player's ship.
While the player and player's ship are not differentiated in Oolite, such a
separation makes more sense conceptually and design-wise, and we might want to
make it that way in the future. The scripting interface anticipates this by
using two separate objects for the player and player's ship.

The -javaScriptValue of the PlayerEntity is the player's ship.
