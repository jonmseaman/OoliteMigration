OOJSPlanet+ObjCBridge.mm

The Objective-C left over from OOJSPlanet.mm (bead oo-7ixd; proposed ADR-0056 amendments oo-ppc and
oo-ykoy): OOPlanetEntity (OOJavaScriptExtensions), the category through which the engine asks a
OOPlanetEntity for its JS side by selector. Its methods stay methods of OOPlanetEntity, each
forwarding in one line to the C++ function in OOJSPlanet.mm that holds its old body. Deleted when
OOPlanetEntity converts (oo-mp0d): the methods then become members of the C++ OOPlanetEntity that
call the same functions.
