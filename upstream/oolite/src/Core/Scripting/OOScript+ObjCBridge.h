OOScript+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, Amendment 1 of bead oo-cwz; bead oo-604l): the Objective-C
OOScript, a facade over the C++ cxx::OOScript (OOScript.h). Its interface is the one OOScript.h
declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types, same superclass; the
ivars are one C++ reference), so its callers compile and behave unchanged. Imported as the last
line of OOScript.h; do not import it directly.

It is also the superclass of the Objective-C OOJSScript and of the OOPListScript facade (amendment
oo-o89), so one Objective-C class has two kinds of instance, as amendment oo-6bux's root has:

	instance                              its C++ part                 made by
	------------------------------------  ---------------------------  ------------------------------
	an Objective-C subclass's             an adapter, whose virtual    [[Sub alloc] init]
	  (OOJSScript, OOPListScript)         members message it
	the facade of a C++ script            the script                   [[OOScript alloc] init], or
	                                                                   oo::ToObjC

The Objective-C object owns its C++ part. On a subclass instance, the methods a subclass overrides
(-cxx_name, -scriptDescription, -cxx_version, -requiresTickle, -runWithTarget:,
-cxx_descriptionComponents) answer with the base's own member, as [super ...] or a subclass that
does not override did. The category OOScript (JavaScriptEvents) stays in OOJSScript.h/.mm.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  --------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OOScript *                      nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        cxx::OOScript *
	  handing a script to Objective-C                                      oo::ToObjC(script)
	  taking one from Objective-C                                          oo::ToCxx(objcScript)

Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead
once no file outside OOScript.* names the Objective-C class and its subclasses derive from the C++
one. The ivar is _cxxRootScript, not _cxxScript, because the OOPListScript facade has its own.
