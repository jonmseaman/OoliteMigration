OOJSEngineTimeManagement+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-cn4o): the Objective-C OOTimeProfile and
OOTimeProfileEntry, facades over the C++ cxx::OOTimeProfile and cxx::OOTimeProfileEntry
(OOJSEngineTimeManagement.h), for what is not converted yet: the debug console, which holds the
profile OOJSEndProfiling() returns (+1) and describes it or converts it to JavaScript, and the
engine, which converts a profile and each entry in its "profiles" list through
-oo_jsValueInContext:. Their interfaces are the ones OOJSEngineTimeManagement.h declared before the
conversion, copied exactly (same selectors and types; the ivar is the C++ object), plus the two
OOObject overrides they had (-cxx_description, -oo_jsValueInContext:). Imported as the last line
of OOJSEngineTimeManagement.h; do not import it directly.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  -------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OOTimeProfile(Entry) *          nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        oo::Ref<cxx::OOTimeProfile(Entry)>
	  handing one to Objective-C                                            oo::ToObjC(profile)
	  taking one from Objective-C                                           oo::ToCxx(objcProfile)

oo::ToObjC gives an object's one live facade (oo::ObjCPeers), or a new one. Never add to this file;
converted code does not message the facades. Deleted by its deletion bead once the debug console
and the engine's object conversion are C++.
