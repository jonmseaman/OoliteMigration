OOProbabilitySet.h

A collection for selecting objects randomly, with probability weighting.
Probability weights can be 0 - an object may be in the set but not selectable.
Comes in mutable and immutable variants.

Performance characteristics:
  *	randomObject(), the primary method, is O(log n) for immutable
	OOProbabilitySets and O(n) for mutable ones.
  *	containsObject() and probabilityForObject() are O(n). This could be
	optimized, but there's currently no need.
