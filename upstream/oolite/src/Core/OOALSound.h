OOALSound.h

OOALSound - OpenAL sound implementation for Oolite.

C++20 since bead oo-2en, the Audio module's pattern seam (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-2en).
Bead oo-9ht.68 deleted its Objective-C facade and moved it to the global namespace: the sound
sources, the channels, the resource manager, the player and the JS Sound class hold and call the
C++ sound (oo::Ref).
