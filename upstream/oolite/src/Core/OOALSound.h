OOALSound.h

OOALSound - OpenAL sound implementation for Oolite.

C++20 since bead oo-2en, the Audio module's pattern seam (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-2en).
The class is cxx::OOSound while OOALSound+ObjCBridge.h, imported at the end of this header, keeps
the Objective-C OOSound that its callers message and its unconverted subclasses
(OOALBufferedSound, OOALStreamedSound, OOMusic) derive from; the bridge's deletion bead moves it
out of namespace cxx.
