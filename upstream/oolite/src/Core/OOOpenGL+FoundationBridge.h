OOOpenGL+FoundationBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0043, "Transitional bridges"; bead oo-zpz4, made by chunk oo-3rb.143).
OOCheckOpenGLErrors() as it was declared before its sweep, with the same name, type and linkage,
forwarding to cxx_OOCheckOpenGLErrors in OOOpenGL.h. It exists so that its callers compile
unchanged; each caller moves to cxx_OOCheckOpenGLErrors in its own sweep bead (a literal context
-> the printf form; `%@, self` -> the function form with oo::DescriptionOf(self)). When `git grep`
finds no caller of it, the bridge bead deletes this file, OOOpenGL+FoundationBridge.mm, its line
in Core/meson.build and the #import at the end of OOOpenGL.h. Never add to it; never call it from
migrated code. oo-qps (the removal of gnustep-base) cannot compile while it exists.

Registry: src/oofnd/README.md, "Transitional bridges".
