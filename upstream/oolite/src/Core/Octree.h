		node. Exactly one node must be added at root level.
		
		The order of child nodes is defined as follows: the index of a child node
		is a three bit number. The highest bit represents x, the middle bit
		represents y and the low bit represents z. A set bit indicates the high-
		coordinate half of the parent node, and a clear bit indicates the low-
		coordinate half.
		
		For instance, if the parent node is a cube ranging from -1 to 1 on each
		axis, the child 101 (5) represents x 0..1, y -1..0, z 0..1.
