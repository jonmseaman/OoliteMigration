OOMusicController+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en): the Objective-C
OOMusicController, a facade over the C++ cxx::OOMusicController (OOMusicController.h), for the
player, the universe and the JS Sound and Mission classes. Its interface is the one
OOMusicController.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly. +sharedController answers one
facade for the life of the process (amendment oo-r7m0 item 5). Imported as the last line of
OOMusicController.h; do not import it directly. Never add to this file; converted code does not
message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once every caller is C++.
