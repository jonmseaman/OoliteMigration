OOSoundSource+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en): the Objective-C OOSoundSource,
a facade over the C++ cxx::OOSoundSource (OOSoundSource.h), for the code that makes and messages
sound sources and for the channels, which call a playing source back through
-channel:didFinishPlayingSound: (and a stopped one's class through the class method). Its interface
is the one OOSoundSource.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly. A playing source's facade
is kept alive by the source itself, as the old object kept itself (amendment oo-kdyh item 2). The
categories in Universe.h (OOCustomSounds) and OOJSSoundSource+ObjCBridge.mm (the JS glue) stay
categories of this class. Imported as the last line of OOSoundSource.h; do not import it directly.

oo::ToObjC(oo::ToCxx(s)) == s. Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade.
Deleted by its deletion bead once every caller is C++.
