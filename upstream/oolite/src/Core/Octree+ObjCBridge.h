Octree+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-novu): the Objective-C Octree, a facade over the C++
cxx::Octree (Octree.h), for callers that are not converted yet (ShipEntity, PlayerEntity, OOMesh
and its OOCacheManager category, OOMeshToOctreeConverter's result). Its interface is the one
Octree.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types), so those
callers compile and behave unchanged; each method forwards to its C++ member. OOOctreeBuilder has
no facade: its one caller, OOMeshToOctreeConverter.mm, uses the C++ class. Imported as the last
line of Octree.h; do not import it directly.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  ----------------------------
	still Objective-C                      Octree * (this facade)          nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        oo::Ref<cxx::Octree>, cxx::Octree *
	  handing an octree to Objective-C                                      oo::ToObjC(octree)
	  taking one from Objective-C                                           oo::ToCxx(objcOctree)

oo::ToObjC gives the octree's one live facade (oo::ObjCPeers), so identity survives a round trip:
oo::ToObjC(oo::ToCxx(o)) == o. Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade.
Deleted by its deletion bead once no file outside Octree.* names the Objective-C Octree.
