Manage a set of roles for a ship (or ship type), including probabilities.

A role set is an immutable object.

/*	Foundation sweep (proposed ADR-0036, bead oo-hi38): roles are UTF-8 std::strings. An empty
	role means "no role", as nil did. Results that could be nil are std::optional (a message to a
	nil role set yields std::nullopt / an empty vector). -hasRole: and -intersectsSet: are shared
	selectors (ShipEntity; Foundation sets), so they keep Objective-C object parameters until their family
	bead.
