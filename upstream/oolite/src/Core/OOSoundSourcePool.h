OOSoundSourcePool.h

Manages a fixed number of sound sources and distributes sounds between them.
Each sound has a priority and an expiry time. When a new sound is played, it
replaces (if possible) a sound of lower priority that has expired, a sound of
the same priority that has expired, or a sound of lower priority that has not
expired.

All sounds are specified by customsounds.plist key.

C++20 since bead oo-d2y9 (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en). The class is
cxx::OOSoundSourcePool while OOSoundSourcePool+ObjCBridge.h, imported at the end of this header,
keeps the Objective-C OOSoundSourcePool that the player's sound category makes and messages; the
bridge's deletion bead moves it out of namespace cxx.
