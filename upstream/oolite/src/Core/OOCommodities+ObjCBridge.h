OOCommodities+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-fqyw): the Objective-C OOCommodities, a facade over the
C++ cxx::OOCommodities (OOCommodities.h), for callers that are not converted yet (Universe, which
makes it and asks it for markets; PlayerEntity and its categories, which ask it about goods). Its
interface is the one OOCommodities.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same
selectors, same types), so those callers compile and behave unchanged; each method forwards to its
C++ member, and a market it makes crosses back as that market's facade (oo::ToObjC). Imported as
the last line of OOCommodities.h; do not import it directly.
