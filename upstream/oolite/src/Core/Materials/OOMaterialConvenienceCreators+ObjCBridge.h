OOMaterialConvenienceCreators+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-o89 item 4): the category OOConvenienceCreators of
the Objective-C OOMaterial facade, for the caller that still messages it (OOMesh). Its interface is
the one OOMaterialConvenienceCreators.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly; each method
forwards to the static member of cxx::OOMaterial of the same name and answers the result's facade.
Imported as the last line of OOMaterialConvenienceCreators.h; do not import it directly. Deleted
by its deletion bead once OOMesh is C++.
