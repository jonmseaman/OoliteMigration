OOCombinedEmissionMapGenerator+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-qa7c, oo-rmd7 item 3 and oo-e6xa): the Objective-C
OOCombinedEmissionMapGenerator, the facade of the C++ cxx::OOCombinedEmissionMapGenerator
(OOCombinedEmissionMapGenerator.h), a subclass of the OOTextureGenerator facade with no ivars. Its
interface is the one OOCombinedEmissionMapGenerator.h declared before the conversion, copied
exactly, for its caller (OOMultiTextureMaterial), whose test stubs the class by name.
Imported as the last line of OOCombinedEmissionMapGenerator.h; do not import it directly.
Deleted by its deletion bead, which turns the caller's messages into the C++ factories.
