OOMultiTextureMaterial+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-smy and oo-vl43): the Objective-C
OOMultiTextureMaterial, a facade over the C++ cxx::OOMultiTextureMaterial
(OOMultiTextureMaterial.h), for the caller that makes it (OOMaterialConvenienceCreators). Its
interface is the one OOMultiTextureMaterial.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly, so it
compiles and behaves unchanged. Imported as the last line of OOMultiTextureMaterial.h; do not
import it directly.

It has no ivars: the root facade's _cxxMaterial holds the C++ material (ADR-0056 amendment of bead
oo-up4b, item 3). Its initialiser makes a new C++ material, whose facade it is from then on, or
answers nil where the Objective-C initialiser did. What it inherits reaches the C++ overrides
through the facades above it (-apply too: it is virtual since this bead). No Objective-C class
derives from it. Never add to this file. Deleted by its deletion bead once its caller is C++.
