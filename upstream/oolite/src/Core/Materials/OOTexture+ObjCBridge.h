OOTexture+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-smy and oo-2en): the Objective-C OOTexture, a
facade over the C++ cxx::OOTexture (OOTexture.h), for the callers that message textures (the
materials, the HUD, the GUI, the planets, the debug support, the scripting bindings) and for the
textures not converted yet (OOConcreteTexture, OONullTexture). Its interface
is the one OOTexture.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types,
same superclass), so they compile and behave unchanged; OOTextureInternal.h's categories are its
categories. Imported as the last line of OOTexture.h; do not import it directly.

It is a hierarchy root's facade, as OOALSound+ObjCBridge.h is; the table there applies here:

	the texture is                       its facade is                      virtual calls on the
	                                                                          C++ side reach
	-----------------------------------  ---------------------------------  ---------------------
	an Objective-C subclass              the subclass instance itself, and  the subclass's
	  (unconverted, [[X alloc] init])    an adapter is its C++ part         methods
	a C++ subclass (converted)           made by oo::ToObjC, one live one   the C++ overrides
	                                     per texture (oo::ObjCPeers)

The factories answer the Objective-C texture (an OOConcreteTexture or the OONullTexture), which
cxx::OOTexture's static factories make. A converted caller that keeps a texture while any
subclass is Objective-C holds oo::ObjCRef<OOTexture *>: an Objective-C texture's C++ part does
not retain it. The debug retain tracing flag is cxx::OOTexture's (the subclasses read it); its
traced -retain/-release/-autorelease overrides are gone (amendment oo-whzh item 4).

A converted subclass that its callers message by its own selectors has a facade of its own, a
subclass of this one with no ivars (amendment oo-up4b item 3): oo::ToObjC picks the Objective-C
class named as the C++ class is, else OOTexture.

oo::ToObjC(oo::ToCxx(t)) == t for both kinds. Never add to this file; converted code does not
message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once every caller and every texture is C++.

	If kOOTextureAllowRectTexture is set, and GL_EXT_texture_rectangle is

	as rectangle textures. Rectangle textures use unnormalized co-ordinates;
	that is, co-oridinates range from 0 to the actual size of the texture
	rather than 0 to 1. Thus, for rectangle textures, -texCoordsScale returns
	-dimensions (with the required wait for loading) for a rectangle texture.
	For non-rectangle textures, (1, 1) is returned without delay. If the
	texture has power-of-two dimensions, it will be loaded as a normal
	texture.
	
	Rectangle textures have additional limitations: kOOTextureMinFilterMipMap
	is not supported (kOOTextureMinFilterLinear will be used instead), and
	kOOTextureRepeatS/kOOTextureRepeatT will be ignored. 
	
	Note that 'rectangle texture' is a misnomer; non-rectangle textures may
	be rectangular, as long as their sides are powers of two. Non-power-of-two
	textures would be more descriptive, but this phrase is used for the
	extension that allows 'normal' textures to have non-power-of-two sides
	without additional restrictions. It is intended that OOTexture should
	support this in future, but this shouldn’t affect the interface, only
	avoid the scaling-to-power-of-two stage.
