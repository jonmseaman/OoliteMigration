OOMultiTextureMaterial.h

A material that uses multitexturing and texture combiners.

C++20 since bead oo-lh0x (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-smy and oo-vl43). Its Objective-C
facade was deleted by bead oo-9ht.42 (ADR-0056 amendment "deleting a facade"): the class is global,
and Objective-C sees one as an OOMaterial (OOBasicMaterial's facade was deleted by bead oo-9ht.33).
