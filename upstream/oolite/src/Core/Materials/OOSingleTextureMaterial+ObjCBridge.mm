OOSingleTextureMaterial+ObjCBridge.mm

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-smy and oo-vl43): the Objective-C
OOSingleTextureMaterial facade (see OOSingleTextureMaterial+ObjCBridge.h). Its initialisers run the
C++ factories and adopt the result. Deleted with OOSingleTextureMaterial+ObjCBridge.h.
