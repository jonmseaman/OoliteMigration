OOMaterial.h

A material which can be applied to an OpenGL object, or more accurately, to
the current OpenGL render state.

This is an abstract class; actual materials should be subclasses.

Currently, only shader materials are supported. Direct use of textures should
also be replaced with an OOMaterial subclass.

C++20 since bead oo-smy, the Materials module exemplar (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-smy).
The class is cxx::OOMaterial while OOMaterial+ObjCBridge.h, imported at the end of this header,
keeps the Objective-C OOMaterial that its callers message and its unconverted subclasses derive
from; the bridge's deletion bead moves it out of namespace cxx.
