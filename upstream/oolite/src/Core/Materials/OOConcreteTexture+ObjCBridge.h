OOConcreteTexture+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-up4b item 3 and oo-whzh): the Objective-C
OOConcreteTexture, the facade of the C++ cxx::OOConcreteTexture (OOConcreteTexture.h), a subclass
of the OOTexture facade with no ivars. Its interface is the one OOConcreteTexture.h declared
before the conversion; a C++ concrete texture crossing to Objective-C is one of these, so code
that tests a texture's class still finds it. Imported as the last line of OOConcreteTexture.h; do
not import it directly. Deleted, with OOTexture+ObjCBridge.h, once every caller is C++.
