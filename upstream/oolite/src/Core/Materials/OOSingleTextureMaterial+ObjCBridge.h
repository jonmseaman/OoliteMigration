OOSingleTextureMaterial+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-smy and oo-vl43): the Objective-C
OOSingleTextureMaterial, a facade over the C++ cxx::OOSingleTextureMaterial
(OOSingleTextureMaterial.h), for the callers that make it (OOPlanetDrawable, OOPlanetEntity,
OOMaterialConvenienceCreators). Its interface is the one OOSingleTextureMaterial.h declared before
the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types), so they compile and behave unchanged.
Imported as the last line of OOSingleTextureMaterial.h; do not import it directly.

It has no ivars: the root facade's _cxxMaterial holds the C++ material (ADR-0056 amendment of bead
oo-up4b, item 3). Its initialisers make a new C++ material, whose facade it is from then on, or
answer nil where the Objective-C initialiser did. What it inherits (the basic material's selectors,
-doApply and the rest) reaches the C++ overrides through the facades above it. No Objective-C class
derives from it. Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade. Deleted by its
deletion bead once every caller is C++.
