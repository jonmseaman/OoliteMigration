OOSingleTextureMaterial.h

A material with a single texture (and no shaders).

C++20 since bead oo-zxzb (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-smy and oo-vl43). Its Objective-C
facade was deleted by bead oo-9ht.38 (ADR-0056 amendment "deleting a facade"): the class is global,
and Objective-C sees one as the nearest facade, OOBasicMaterial's.
