OONullTexture+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-up4b item 3 and oo-whzh): the Objective-C
OONullTexture, the facade of the C++ cxx::OONullTexture (OONullTexture.h), a subclass of the
OOTexture facade with no ivars. Its interface is the one OONullTexture.h declared before the
conversion. OOTexture's +nullTexture answers it, and code that tests a texture's class still finds
it. Imported as the last line of OONullTexture.h; do not import it directly. Deleted, with
OOTexture+ObjCBridge.h, once every texture and caller is C++.
