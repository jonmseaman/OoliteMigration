/*

OOOXPVerifierStage.h

Pipeline stage for OXP verification pipeline managed by OOOXPVerifier.

C++20 since bead oo-cwz, the Phase 3 class-HIERARCHY exemplar (proposed ADR-0056, Amendment 1;
docs/phases/3-cpp-conversion.md, "Converting a class"). The class is cxx::OOOXPVerifierStage and
its subclass responsibilities are virtual. While Objective-C subclasses and the Objective-C
OOOXPVerifier remain, OOOXPVerifierStage+ObjCBridge.h, imported at the end of this header, keeps
the Objective-C OOOXPVerifierStage they subclass and message; the bridge's deletion bead moves
the class out of namespace cxx.
