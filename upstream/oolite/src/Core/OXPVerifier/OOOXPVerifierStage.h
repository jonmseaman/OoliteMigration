/*	This is called once by the verifier.
	When it is called, all the verifier stages listed in -requiredStages will
	have run. At this point, it is possible to access them using the
	verifier's -stageWithName: method in order to query them about results.
	Stages whose dependencies have all run will be released, so the result of
	calling -stageWithName: with a name not in -requiredStages is undefined.
	
	shouldRun can be overridden to avoid running at all (without anything
	being logged). For dependency resolution purposes, returning NO from
	shouldRun counts as running; that is, it will stop this verifier stage
	from running but will not stop dependencies from running.
