OOOXPVerifierStage.h

Pipeline stage for OXP verification pipeline managed by OOOXPVerifier.

C++20 since bead oo-cwz, the Phase 3 class-HIERARCHY exemplar (proposed ADR-0056, Amendment 1;
docs/phases/3-cpp-conversion.md, "Converting a class"); its subclass responsibilities are virtual.
Bead oo-9ht.4 deleted its transitional Objective-C facade (the class's bridge files) once the
verifier and every stage were C++, and moved the class out of namespace cxx (ADR-0056 amendment
"deleting a facade"): the verifier keeps and drives the C++ stages themselves.
