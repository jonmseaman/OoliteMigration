OOOXPVerifier+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-tsa4): the Objective-C OOOXPVerifier, a facade over the
C++ cxx::OOOXPVerifier (OOOXPVerifier.h), for GameController (+runVerificationIfRequested) and the
stages, which keep it as their verifier and message it. Its interface is the one OOOXPVerifier.h
declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types), so they compile and
behave unchanged; the categories that other files add to it (-fileScannerStage,
-textureVerifierStage, -modelVerifierStage) are unchanged too. Imported as the last line of
OOOXPVerifier.h; do not import it directly.

Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead.
