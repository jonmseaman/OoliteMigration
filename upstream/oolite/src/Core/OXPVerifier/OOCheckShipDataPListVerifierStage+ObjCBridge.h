OOCheckShipDataPListVerifierStage+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056 amendment oo-rmd7 item 1, bead oo-1v2w): the schema verifier's
delegate for the C++ OOCheckShipDataPListVerifierStage. OOPListSchemaVerifier is Objective-C and
messages its delegate through the informal protocol OOPListSchemaVerifierDelegate (a category on
OOObject), so the delegate is an Objective-C object: this helper, which the stage makes in run()
and which forwards both delegate methods to the stage's members. Imported as the last line of
OOCheckShipDataPListVerifierStage.h; do not import it directly. Deleted by its deletion bead once
OOPListSchemaVerifier is C++, when the stage becomes the delegate again.
