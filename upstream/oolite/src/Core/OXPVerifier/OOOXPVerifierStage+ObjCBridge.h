OOOXPVerifierStage+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056 Amendment 1, bead oo-cwz): the Objective-C OOOXPVerifierStage, a
facade over the C++ cxx::OOOXPVerifierStage (OOOXPVerifierStage.h), for the Objective-C verifier
and for the stages not converted yet. Its interface is the one OOOXPVerifierStage.h declared
before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types), so they compile and behave
unchanged; OOOXPVerifierStageInternal.h still declares its OOInternal category. Imported as the
last line of OOOXPVerifierStage.h; do not import it directly.

A class with subclasses has two kinds of facade, one class:

	the stage is                         its facade is                      virtual calls on the
	                                                                          C++ side reach
	-----------------------------------  ---------------------------------  ---------------------
	an Objective-C subclass              the subclass instance itself; its  the subclass's
	  (unconverted, [[X alloc] init])    -init made its C++ part, an        methods (-cxx_name,
	                                     adapter that forwards the virtual  -run, ...), as
	                                     members to it                      overriding did
	a C++ subclass (converted)           made by oo::ToObjC, one live one   the C++ overrides
	                                     per stage (oo::ObjCPeers)

An Objective-C subclass's [super cxx_name] (and -cxx_dependencies, -dependents, -shouldRun,
-run) reaches the C++ base class's own member, not the virtual one, so it does what the base did.
An Objective-C subclass of a converted intermediate class (OOFileHandlingVerifierStage, bead
oo-up4b) is the same kind, with an adapter over that class, oo::ObjCStage<cxx::Mid>, and reaches
cxx::Mid's own members. A converted class with a facade of its own (cxx::X, facade X) is the
second kind; oo::ToObjC makes an X for it.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                      crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ----------------------------------  -----------------
	still Objective-C (the verifier,       OOOXPVerifierStage * (this facade)  nothing
	  unconverted stages)
	converted (C++)                        oo::Ref<cxx::OOOXPVerifierStage>
	  handing a stage to Objective-C                                           oo::ToObjC(stage)
	  taking one from Objective-C                                              oo::ToCxx(objcStage)

oo::ToObjC(oo::ToCxx(s)) == s for both kinds. Never add to this file; converted code does not
message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once the verifier and every stage are C++.
