/*	Foundation sweep (proposed ADR-0043, bead oo-asx8): the models to check are a vector of
	distinct entries, in the order they were reported. Materials and shaders are plist data
	(oo::PList, null for none). nameForReverseDependencyForVerifier() is a shared name (the
	other stages declare it) and, flipped with the others, returns a std::string (bead oo-3rb.274.2).

	C++20 since bead oo-5zby (proposed ADR-0056 Amendment 1, amendments oo-up4b and oo-94qk): a
	subclass of cxx::OOTextureHandlingStage. It is global and has no facade: its one caller, the
	ship data stage, calls these members, and the Objective-C verifier holds it as an
	OOOXPVerifierStage (oo::ToObjC). The verifier's -modelVerifierStage, a category of an
	Objective-C class, is in OOModelVerifierStage+ObjCBridge.h, imported at the end of this header.
