/*	Foundation sweep (proposed ADR-0043, bead oo-bfgm): the whitelist and the used AI names are
	sorted std::vectors of strings (sets). nameForReverseDependencyForVerifier() is a shared
	name (the other stages declare it) and, flipped with the others, returns a std::string (bead oo-3rb.274.2).

	C++20 since bead oo-94qk (proposed ADR-0056 Amendment 1, amendment oo-up4b item 6): a leaf of
	OOFileHandlingVerifierStage. It is global and has no facade: its one caller,
	OOCheckShipDataPListVerifierStage, calls these members, and the verifier holds it (as its
	OOOXPVerifierStage facade until bead oo-9ht.4) and makes it from its name through a table.
