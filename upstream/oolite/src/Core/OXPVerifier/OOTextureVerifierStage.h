and ensures they are loadable.

/*	Foundation sweep (proposed ADR-0043, bead oo-0iq2): the used texture names are a sorted
	std::vector (a set), checked in byte order of the name. nameForReverseDependencyForVerifier() is a shared name
	(the other stages declare it) and, flipped with the others, returns a std::string (bead oo-3rb.274.2).

	C++20 since bead oo-tuq8 (proposed ADR-0056 Amendment 1, amendment oo-up4b items 2 and 6).
	OOTextureVerifierStage is a leaf of cxx::OOFileHandlingVerifierStage; it is global and has no
	facade, because nothing outside this file messages it (the verifier makes it from its name,
	kCxxStages in OOOXPVerifier.mm). OOTextureHandlingStage is an intermediate class that the ship
	data and model stages subclass; its Objective-C facade was deleted by bead oo-9ht.45 once they
	were C++ (ADR-0056 amendment "deleting a facade"), with the verifier's -textureVerifierStage.
