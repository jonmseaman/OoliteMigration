OOTextureVerifierStage+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056 amendment oo-up4b items 2 and 4, bead oo-tuq8): the Objective-C
facade of the C++ intermediate class cxx::OOTextureHandlingStage (OOTextureVerifierStage.h), and
the verifier's -textureVerifierStage, for the stages not converted yet. Imported as the last line
of OOTextureVerifierStage.h; do not import it directly.

	OOTextureHandlingStage  the superclass of the Objective-C texture-handling stages (ship data,
	                        model). Its -init makes their C++ part, an
	                        oo::ObjCStage<cxx::OOTextureHandlingStage>, so -dependents, and
	                        [super dependents], answer what cxx::OOTextureHandlingStage does.

-textureVerifierStage has no caller left; it answers the texture stage's facade (an
OOOXPVerifierStage: the stage is a global C++ class with no Objective-C class of its own).

Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead
once the ship data and model stages are C++.
