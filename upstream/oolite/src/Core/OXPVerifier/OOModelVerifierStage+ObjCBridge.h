OOModelVerifierStage+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056 amendment oo-up4b item 4, bead oo-5zby): the verifier's
-modelVerifierStage, a category of the Objective-C OOOXPVerifier, which the ship data stage calls
to find the model stage. It answers the model stage's facade (an OOOXPVerifierStage: the stage is
a global C++ class with no Objective-C class of its own). Imported as the last line of
OOModelVerifierStage.h; do not import it directly. Deleted by its deletion bead once the verifier
is C++ (oo-tsa4), which finds the stage itself.
