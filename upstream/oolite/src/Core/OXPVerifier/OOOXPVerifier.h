OOOXPVerifier.h

Oolite expansion pack verification manager.

NOTE: the overall design is discussed in OXP verifier design.txt.

C++20 since bead oo-tsa4 (proposed ADR-0056 and its OXPVerifier amendments). The stages keep and
call it, and GameController calls its static runVerificationIfRequested() (bead oo-qg71f); global
since bead oo-9ht.130 deleted its transitional Objective-C facade. The stages are C++
(OOOXPVerifierStage, global since bead oo-9ht.4 deleted its facade), kept and driven as they are.
