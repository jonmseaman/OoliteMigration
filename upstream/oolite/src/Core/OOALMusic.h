OOALMusic.h

Subclass of OOSound with additional controls specific to music playback. Only
one instance of OOMusic may be playing at a time.

C++20 since bead oo-nwbw (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en). The class is
OOMusic, a subclass of cxx::OOSound; its Objective-C facade was deleted by bead oo-9ht.85.
