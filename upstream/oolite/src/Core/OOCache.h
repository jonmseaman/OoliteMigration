OOCache.h
By Jens Ayton

An OOCache handles storage of a limited number of elements for quick reuse. It
may be used directly for in-memory cache, or indirectly through OOCacheManager
for on-disk cache.

Every OOCache has a 'prune threshold', which controls how many elements it
contains, and an 'auto-prune' flag, which determines how pruning is managed.

If auto-pruning is on, the cache will pruned to 80% of the prune threshold
whenever the prune threshold is exceeded. If auto-pruning is off, the cache
can be pruned to the prune threshold by explicitly calling -prune.

Keys are UTF-8 std::strings and values are oo::PList (proposed ADR-0055 item 2, bead
oo-qps.36): property-list data, or a PList::Object node (OOObjCPList.h) for a live
object such as a texture. An OOCache is essentially a string-keyed dictionary with a
prune limit. A null PList is "no value": it is never stored, and it is what a lookup of
an absent key returns.
