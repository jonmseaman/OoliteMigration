OOProbabilisticTextureManager.h

Manages a set of textures, specified in a property list, with associated
probabilities. To avoid interfering with other PRNG-based code, it uses its
own ranrot state.

C++20 since bead oo-9hdp (Phase 3, proposed ADR-0056). Its one caller, OOSkyDrawable, was
adapted in the bead, so it has no Objective-C facade and is global (ADR-0056 item 5).
