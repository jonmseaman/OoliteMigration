OOPolygonSprite+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-4111): the Objective-C OOPolygonSprite, a facade over the
C++ cxx::OOPolygonSprite (OOPolygonSprite.h), for callers that are not converted yet (the HUD's
missile icons, and the beacon icons of ShipEntity, OOVisualEffectEntity and OOWaypointEntity). Its
interface is the one OOPolygonSprite.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same
selectors, same types, and the HUD's OOHUDBeaconIcon category), so those callers compile and
behave unchanged; each method forwards to its C++ member. Imported as the last line of
OOPolygonSprite.h; do not import it directly.

The facade is also the sprite's OOGraphicsResetClient: the manager holds Objective-C clients,
unretained, so each facade registers itself while it lives and forwards -resetGraphicsState
(ADR-0056 amendment oo-4111). Converted code that makes a sprite keeps its facade alive while it
draws it, until OOGraphicsResetManager is C++.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  ----------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OOPolygonSprite * (this facade) nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        oo::Ref<cxx::OOPolygonSprite>, cxx::OOPolygonSprite *
	  handing a sprite to Objective-C                                       oo::ToObjC(sprite)
	  taking one from Objective-C                                           oo::ToCxx(objcSprite)

oo::ToObjC gives the sprite's one live facade (oo::ObjCPeers), so identity survives a round trip.
Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead
once no file outside OOPolygonSprite.* names the Objective-C OOPolygonSprite.
