OOALSoundDecoder+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en): the Objective-C
OOALSoundDecoder, a facade over the C++ cxx::OOALSoundDecoder (OOALSoundDecoder.h), for the code
that still messages decoders: the sounds (OOALBufferedSound, OOALStreamedSound) and the root's class
cluster in OOALSound.mm, whose test stubs this class by name (amendment oo-rmd7 item 3). Its
interface is the one OOALSoundDecoder.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same
selectors, same types), so they compile and behave unchanged. Imported as the last line of
OOALSoundDecoder.h; do not import it directly.

oo::ToObjC(oo::ToCxx(d)) == d. Never add to this file; converted code does not message the
facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once every caller is C++.
