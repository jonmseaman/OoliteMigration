OOCacheManager+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-rmd7): the Objective-C OOCacheManager, a facade over the
C++ cxx::OOCacheManager (OOCacheManager.h), for callers that are not converted yet. Its interface
is the one OOCacheManager.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same
types), so those callers, and the categories other files add to it (OOMesh.mm's OOMesh and Octree
caches), compile and behave unchanged; each method forwards to its C++ member.
Imported as the last line of OOCacheManager.h; do not import it directly.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  ----------------------------
	still Objective-C                      [OOCacheManager sharedCache]    nothing
	converted (C++)                        cxx::OOCacheManager::sharedCache()   nothing

The manager is a singleton: +sharedCache answers one facade for the life of the process, as it
answered one object before (proposed ADR-0056 amendment oo-r7m0, item 5).

OOAsyncCacheWriter, the task that writes the cache on a worker thread, is also here: it adopts
the Objective-C protocol OOAsyncWorkTask (in its @implementation, so this header does not need
OOAsyncWorkManager.h), and becomes a C++ task when that protocol becomes a C++ interface
(proposed ADR-0056 amendment oo-rmd7). Never add to this file; converted code does not message
the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once no file outside OOCacheManager.* names the
Objective-C class.
