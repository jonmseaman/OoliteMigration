OOPolygonSprite.h
Oolite

Two-dimensional polygon object for UI things such as missile icons.

C++20 since bead oo-4111 (proposed ADR-0056). Its Objective-C facade was deleted by bead oo-9ht.30
(ADR-0056 amendment "deleting a facade"): the class is global, it is its own graphics reset client,
and it is an OOHUDBeaconIcon, the C++ interface that replaced the protocol of that name (bead
oo-7ae4p), which the entities hold their beacon drawables by.
