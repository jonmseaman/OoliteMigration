OOMesh+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-dnbf): the Objective-C OOMesh, a facade over the C++
cxx::OOMesh (OOMesh.h), for the code that is not converted yet: the callers that message meshes
(the ship and visual effect entities, the ship registry, the scripting bindings). Its interface is the one OOMesh.h declared before the
conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types), less the ivars, which are the C++ class's
members; the graphics-reset conformance is declared in a category below. Each
method of the class forwards to its C++ member. Imported as the last line of OOMesh.h; do not
import it directly.

It is a converted subclass's facade under the drawables' root facade (amendment oo-up4b item 3):
it has no ivars, OODrawable's holds its C++ part, and OODrawable's methods for the overridable
members reach cxx::OOMesh's overrides.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  ----------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OOMesh * (this facade)          nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        oo::Ref<cxx::OOMesh>
	  handing the mesh to Objective-C                                      oo::ToObjC(mesh)
	  taking it from Objective-C                                           oo::ToCxx(objcMesh)

The C++ mesh is its own graphics reset client (amendment oo-rdwg item 3); the facade keeps the
conformance and forwards -resetGraphicsState for any Objective-C sender. oo::ToObjC(oo::ToCxx(m)) == m.
Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead
once every caller is C++.
