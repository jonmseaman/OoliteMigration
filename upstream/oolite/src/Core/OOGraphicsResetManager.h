OOGraphicsResetManager.h

Tracks objects with state that needs to be reset when the graphics context is
modified (for instance, when switching between windowed and full-screen mode
in SDL builds). This means re-uploading all textures, and also resetting any
display lists relying on old texture names. All objects which have display
lists must therefore register with the OOGraphicsResetManager on init, and
unregister on dealloc.

C++20 since bead oo-jpd8 (proposed ADR-0056). The class is cxx::OOGraphicsResetManager while
OOGraphicsResetManager+ObjCBridge.h, imported at the end of this header, keeps the Objective-C
OOGraphicsResetManager its unconverted callers message, and the OOGraphicsResetClient protocol its
clients adopt; the bridge's deletion bead moves the class out of namespace cxx.
