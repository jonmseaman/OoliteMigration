OOGraphicsResetManager.h

Tracks objects with state that needs to be reset when the graphics context is
modified (for instance, when switching between windowed and full-screen mode
in SDL builds). This means re-uploading all textures, and also resetting any
display lists relying on old texture names. All objects which have display
lists must therefore register with the OOGraphicsResetManager on init, and
unregister on dealloc.

C++20 since bead oo-jpd8 (proposed ADR-0056). Its Objective-C facade and the OOGraphicsResetClient
protocol were deleted by bead oo-9ht.23 (ADR-0056 amendment "deleting a facade"): the class is
global, and every client is a C++ OOGraphicsResetClient.
