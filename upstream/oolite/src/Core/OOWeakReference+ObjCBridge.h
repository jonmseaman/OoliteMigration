OOWeakReference+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-3kqi): the Objective-C OOWeakReference, a facade over
the C++ cxx::OOWeakReference (OOWeakReference.h), with the OOWeakReferenceSupport protocol and
OOWeakRefObject, for the Objective-C code that holds objects weakly. The interfaces are the ones
OOWeakReference.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly but for the facade's one ivar;
each facade method forwards to its C++ member. Imported as the last line of OOWeakReference.h;
do not import it directly.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  ----------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OOWeakReference * (the facade)  nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++), holding an            oo::ObjCRef<OOWeakReference *>  oo::ToCxx(ref)->member()
	  Objective-C object weakly
	converted (C++), holding a C++ object  oo::WeakRef<T> (oofnd/Ref.hpp)  not this class at all

The facade is the reference's identity (ADR-0056 amendment oo-3kqi): its callers compare it
(weakRef == weakSelf), hash it and keep it in sets, and the referred object keeps an unretained
pointer to it (weakSelf). So the facade makes and owns its C++ object, as a facade over a subclass
of an Objective-C class does (amendment oo-o89): oo::ToObjC answers the live facade or nil and
never makes one, and converted code holds the facade, never the C++ object alone. The protocol,
OOWeakRefObject (whose subclasses are Objective-C: Entity, Universe, AI, OOTexture and more) and
the OOObject category stay Objective-C here until the classes that use them are converted; then
they and this file go, and oo::WeakRef replaces them. Never add to this file.


Weak reference class for Cocoa/GNUstep/OpenStep. As it stands, this will not
work as a weak reference in a garbage-collected environment.

A weak reference allows code to maintain a reference to an object while
allowing the object to reach a retain count of zero and deallocate itself.
To function, the referenced object must implement the OOWeakReferenceSupport
protocol.

Client use is extremely simple: to get a weak reference to the object, call
-weakRetain and use the returned proxy instead of the actual object. When
finished, release the proxy. Messages sent to the proxy will be forwarded as
long as the underlying object exists; beyond that, they will act exactly like
messages to nil. (IMPORTANT: this means messages returning floating-point or
struct values have undefined return values, so use -weakRefUnderlyingObject in
such cases.) Example:

@interface ThingWatcher: OOObject
{
@private
	Thing			*thing;
}
@end

@implementation ThingWatcher
- (void)setThing:(Thing *)aThing
{
	[thing release];
	thing = [aThing weakRetain];
}

- (void)frobThing
{
	[thing frob];
}

- (void)dealloc
{
	[thing release];
	[super dealloc];
}
@end


Note that the only reference to OOWeakReference being involved is the call to
weakRetain instead of retain. However, the following would not work:
	thing = aThing;
	[thing weakRetain];

Additionally, it is not possible to access instance variables directly -- but
then, that's a filthy habit.

OOWeakReferenceSupport implementation is also simple:

@interface Thing: OOObject <OOWeakReferenceSupport>
{
@private
	OOWeakReference		*weakSelf;
}
@end

@implementation Thing
- (id)weakRetain
{
	if (weakSelf == nil)  weakSelf = [OOWeakReference weakRefWithObject:self];
	return [weakSelf retain];
}

- (void)weakRefDied:(OOWeakReference *)weakRef
{
	if (weakRef == weakSelf)  weakSelf = nil;
}

- (void)dealloc
{
	[weakSelf weakRefDrop];	// Very important!
	[super dealloc];
}

- (void)frob
{
	NSBeep();
}
@end
