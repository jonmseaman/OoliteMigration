OOAsyncWorkManager+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-x2wy): the Objective-C OOAsyncWorkManager, a facade over
the C++ cxx::OOAsyncWorkManager (OOAsyncWorkManager.h), for callers that are not converted yet,
and the OOAsyncWorkTask protocol their task classes adopt. The interface and the protocol are the
ones OOAsyncWorkManager.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly, so those callers
compile and behave unchanged; each method forwards to its C++ member. Imported as the last line
of OOAsyncWorkManager.h; do not import it directly.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  ----------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OOAsyncWorkManager *            nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        cxx::OOAsyncWorkManager *       oo::ToObjC / oo::ToCxx

The manager is an immortal singleton, and so is its facade: +sharedAsyncWorkManager answers the
same object for the life of the process, as it did. Tasks stay Objective-C objects conforming to
OOAsyncWorkTask until their classes convert (ADR-0056 amendment oo-x2wy). Never add to this file.
Deleted by its deletion bead once no file outside OOAsyncWorkManager.* names the Objective-C
OOAsyncWorkManager or OOAsyncWorkTask.
