OOFoundationException.h

The exception half of the NSException -> OOException sweep (beads oo-3rb.27 ff., proposed
ADR-0029 Decision 4 and ADR-0037). Objective-C++ only; deleted by oo-qps together with
gnustep-base.

Game code raises OOException (oofnd/objc/OOException.h). While gnustep-base is linked, gnustep-base
itself still raises NSExceptions (collection range errors, plist parsing, unrecognised selectors),
and a `@catch (OOException *)` does not catch those. A handler that must go on catching them has
two clauses, the converted one first:

	@catch (OOException *exception)
	{
		OOLog(kOOLogException, @"... %@ : %@", oo::NSStringFrom([exception name]), oo::NSStringFrom([exception reason]));
	}
	@catch (OOFoundationException *exception)
	{
		OOLog(kOOLogException, @"... %@ : %@", [exception name], [exception reason]);	// as before
	}

The second clause keeps the handler's original text, so what gnustep-base raises is
handled exactly as it was; the first bridges the UTF-8 name and reason (OOStringBridge.h) into the
same format, so both write the same line. A handler that only ever sees the game's own exceptions
needs the first clause alone. OOFoundationException is the only name game code uses for Foundation's
exception class; when oo-qps deletes this header every remaining clause stops compiling, and that
compile-error list is the list of clauses to delete.
