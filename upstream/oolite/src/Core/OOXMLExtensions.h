OOXMLExtensions.h

Extensions to Foundation property list classes to export property lists in
XML format, which both Cocoa and GNUstep can read. This is done because
GNUstep defaults to writing a version of OpenStep text-based property lists
that Cocoa can't understand. The XML format is understood by both
implementations, although GNUstep complains about not being able to find the
DTD.
