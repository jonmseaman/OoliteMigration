OOPListParsing+FoundationBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0043, "Transitional bridges"; bead oo-crpp, made by chunk oo-3rb.132).
OOPListParsing's Foundation-typed functions as they were before its sweep, with the same names
and types, forwarding to the cxx_ functions in OOPListParsing.h (the typed wrappers keep their
class test here: they have no twins). It exists so that OOPListParsing's callers compile
unchanged; each caller moves to the cxx_ API in its own sweep bead. When `git grep` finds no
caller of anything declared here, the bridge bead deletes this file,
OOPListParsing+FoundationBridge.mm, its line in Core/meson.build and the #import at the end of
OOPListParsing.h. Never add to it; never call it from migrated code. oo-qps (the removal of
gnustep-base) cannot compile while it exists.

Registry: src/oofnd/README.md, "Transitional bridges".
