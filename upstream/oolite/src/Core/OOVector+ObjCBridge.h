OOVector+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-86ek): the Objective-C OONativeVector, a facade over the
C++ cxx::OONativeVector (OOVector.h), for callers that are not converted yet. Its interface is the
one OOVector.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types), so
those callers compile and behave unchanged; each method forwards to its C++ member. Imported as
the last line of OOVector.h; do not import it directly.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  ----------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OONativeVector * (this facade)  nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        oo::Ref<cxx::OONativeVector>, cxx::OONativeVector *
	  handing a box to Objective-C                                          oo::ToObjC(box)
	  taking one from Objective-C                                           oo::ToCxx(objcBox)

oo::ToObjC gives the box's one live facade (oo::ObjCPeers), so identity survives a round trip:
oo::ToObjC(oo::ToCxx(v)) == v. Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade.
Deleted by its deletion bead once no file outside OOVector.* names the Objective-C OONativeVector.
