OOPriorityQueue.h

A prority queue is a collection into which objects may be inserted in any
order, but (primarily) extracted in sorted order. The order is defined by the
comparison selector specified at creation time, which is assumed to have the
same signature as a compare method used for array sorting:
- (OOComparisonResult)compare:(id)other
and must define a partial order on the objects in the priority queue. The
behaviour when provided with an inconsistent comparison method is undefined.

The implementation is the standard one, a binary heap. It is described in
detail in most algorithm textbooks.

This collection is *not* thread-safe.
