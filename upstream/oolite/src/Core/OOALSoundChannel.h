OOALSoundChannel.h

A channel for audio playback.

This class is an implementation detail. Do not use it directly; use an
OOSoundSource to play an OOSound.

C++20 since bead oo-5vp8 (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en). The class is
cxx::OOSoundChannel while OOALSoundChannel+ObjCBridge.h, imported at the end of this header, keeps
the Objective-C OOSoundChannel that the mixer makes and the sound sources message, and the delegate
category; the bridge's deletion bead moves it out of namespace cxx.

OOALSound - OpenAL sound implementation for Oolite.
