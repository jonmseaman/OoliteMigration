OOALSoundChannel.h

A channel for audio playback.

This class is an implementation detail. Do not use it directly; use an
OOSoundSource to play an OOSound.

C++20 since bead oo-5vp8 (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en). Its Objective-C
facade was deleted by bead oo-9ht.86: the mixer makes and keeps the channels (oo::Ref), the sound
sources hold one borrowed, and the delegate is the C++ interface OOSoundChannelDelegate below.

OOALSound - OpenAL sound implementation for Oolite.
