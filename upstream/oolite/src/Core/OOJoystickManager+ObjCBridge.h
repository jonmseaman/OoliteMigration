OOJoystickManager+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, Amendment 1 of bead oo-cwz; bead oo-6bux): the Objective-C
OOJoystickManager, a facade over the C++ cxx::OOJoystickManager (OOJoystickManager.h). Its
interface is the one OOJoystickManager.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same
selectors, same types, same superclass; the ivars are one C++ reference), so its callers compile
and behave unchanged. Imported as the last line of OOJoystickManager.h; do not import it directly.

It is also the superclass of the Objective-C OOSDLJoystickManager (the SDL manager's facade,
amendment oo-o89), so one Objective-C class has two kinds of instance:

	instance                              its C++ part                 made by
	------------------------------------  ---------------------------  ------------------------------
	an Objective-C subclass's             an adapter, whose virtual    [[Sub alloc] init]
	  (OOSDLJoystickManager)              members message it
	the facade of a C++ manager           the manager                  [[OOJoystickManager alloc]
	                                                                   init], or oo::ToObjC

The Objective-C object owns its C++ part. On a subclass instance, the methods a subclass overrides
(-joystickCount, -nameOfJoystick:, -getAxisWithStick:axis:) answer with the base's own member, as
[super ...] or a subclass that does not override did. +sharedStickHandler makes the shared handler
from the class +setStickHandlerClass: registered, so it stays here.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  --------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OOJoystickManager *             nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        cxx::OOJoystickManager *
	  handing a manager to Objective-C                                     oo::ToObjC(manager)
	  taking one from Objective-C                                          oo::ToCxx(objcManager)

Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead
once no file outside OOJoystickManager.* names the Objective-C class and the SDL manager derives
from the C++ one.
