AIGraphViz.h

GenerateGraphVizForAIStateMachine(), defined in AIGraphViz.mm (DEBUG_GRAPHVIZ builds only). It
was declared by an extern in AI.mm; the Foundation sweep of AI.mm (bead oo-3rb.87) moved the
declaration here, next to its definition. AIGraphViz.mm's own sweep (bead oo-ndxe) gave it the
C++ types AI.mm holds the state machine in.
