OOALStreamedSound.h

OOALStreamedSound - OpenAL sound implementation for Oolite.

C++20 since bead oo-03g7 (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en). The class is
cxx::OOALStreamedSound, a subclass of cxx::OOSound, while OOALStreamedSound+ObjCBridge.h, imported
at the end of this header, keeps the Objective-C OOALStreamedSound that the root's class cluster
makes (OOALSound.mm, whose test stubs it); the bridge's deletion bead moves it out of namespace cxx.
