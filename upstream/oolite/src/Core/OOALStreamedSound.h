OOALStreamedSound.h

OOALStreamedSound - OpenAL sound implementation for Oolite.

C++20 since bead oo-03g7 (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en): a subclass of
cxx::OOSound. Bead oo-9ht.84 deleted its Objective-C facade (OOALStreamedSound+ObjCBridge) and
moved it to the global namespace; the root's class cluster makes it, and it crosses to Objective-C
as the root's facade, an OOSound.
