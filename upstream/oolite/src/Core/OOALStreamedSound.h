OOALStreamedSound.h

OOALStreamedSound - OpenAL sound implementation for Oolite.

C++20 since bead oo-03g7 (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en): a subclass of
OOSound. Bead oo-9ht.84 deleted its Objective-C facade and moved it to the global namespace; the root's
class cluster makes it from the C++ decoder (bead oo-9ht.82).
