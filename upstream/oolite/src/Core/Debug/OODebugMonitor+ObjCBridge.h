OODebugMonitor+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-kq7): the Objective-C OODebugMonitor, a facade over
the C++ cxx::OODebugMonitor (OODebugMonitor.h), for its callers: the debugger (the TCP console
client, which the golden harness drives the game through), the JavaScript console
(OOJSConsole.mm), the debug support, the player's controls and the game controller. Its
interface, and the OODebugMonitorInterface protocol it adopts, are the ones OODebugMonitor.h
declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types), so they compile and
behave unchanged. Imported as the last line of OODebugMonitor.h; do not import it directly.

The monitor is a singleton, and so is its facade: it is made on the first crossing
(oo::ToObjC), keeps the canonical singleton boilerplate (no second instance; -retain and
-release do nothing), and so lives as long as the process. It is the object the console's
JavaScript object is handed (the debugger is handed the C++ monitor since bead oo-9ht.81, the
JavaScript engine its C++ monitor interface since bead oo-9ht.74.1), and its superclass
OOWeakRefObject keeps its weak reference.

Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead
once every caller is C++.
