OOJSConsole+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-vnts item 2 and oo-jy98): an entity's -inspect,
which only the Mac debug OXP's inspector adds (a category on Entity), behind a C++ function for
the console's inspectEntity() (OOJSConsole.mm). Imported by OOJSConsole.mm and
OOJSConsole+ObjCBridge.mm only. Deleted with OOJSConsole+ObjCBridge.mm.
