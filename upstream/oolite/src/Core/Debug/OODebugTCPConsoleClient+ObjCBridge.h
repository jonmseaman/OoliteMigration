OODebugTCPConsoleClient+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendments oo-kq7 and oo-4nhg): the Objective-C
OODebugTCPConsoleClient, a facade over the C++ cxx::OODebugTCPConsoleClient
(OODebugTCPConsoleClient.h), for its callers: the debug support, which makes it, and the debug
monitor, which holds it as its debugger (id<OODebuggerInterface>) and sends it the protocol's
messages. Its interface is the one OODebugTCPConsoleClient.h declared before the conversion,
copied exactly (same selectors, same types, same superclass and protocol), so it compiles and
behaves unchanged. Imported as the last line of OODebugTCPConsoleClient.h; do not import it
directly.

-initWithAddress:port: makes the C++ client (which connects) and answers nil when that fails, as
before; otherwise the facade owns the client and is its peer, so oo::ToObjC answers it while it
lives.

Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead
once every caller is C++ and the debugger interface is.
