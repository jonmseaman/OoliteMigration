OODebugSupport+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-vnts): the debug plug-in controller's
-setUpDebugger, an Objective-C selector the controller may not implement, behind two functions
(OODebugSupport+ObjCBridge.mm) for OODebugSupport.mm. Imported by those two files only. Deleted
with OODebugSupport+ObjCBridge.mm.
