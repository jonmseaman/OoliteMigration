OOCommodities+FoundationBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0043, "Transitional bridges"; bead oo-3rb.154, chunk 1 of oo-19d2).
OOCommodities' Foundation-typed API as it was before its sweep, with the same selector names and
types, forwarding to the cxx_ API in OOCommodities.h. It exists so that OOCommodities' callers
compile unchanged; each caller moves to the cxx_ API in its own sweep bead. When `git grep` finds
no caller of anything declared here, the bridge bead deletes this file,
OOCommodities+FoundationBridge.mm, its line in Core/meson.build and the #import at the end of
OOCommodities.h. Never add to it; never call it from migrated code. oo-qps (the removal of
gnustep-base) cannot compile while it exists.

Registry: src/oofnd/README.md, "Transitional bridges".
