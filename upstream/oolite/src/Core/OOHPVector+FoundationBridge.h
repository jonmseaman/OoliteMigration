OOHPVector+FoundationBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0043, "Transitional bridges"; bead oo-dlox). OOHPVector's Foundation-typed
functions as they were before its sweep, with the same names, types and C linkage, forwarding to
the cxx_ functions in OOHPVector.h. It exists so that OOHPVector's callers compile unchanged; each
caller moves to the cxx_ API in its own sweep bead. When `git grep` finds no caller of anything
declared here, the bridge bead deletes this file, OOHPVector+FoundationBridge.mm, its line in
Core/meson.build and the #import at the end of OOHPVector.h. Never add to it; never call it from
migrated code. oo-qps (the removal of gnustep-base) cannot compile while it exists.

Registry: src/oofnd/README.md, "Transitional bridges".
