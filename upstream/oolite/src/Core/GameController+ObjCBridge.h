GameController+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-zkpmt): the Objective-C GameController, a façade over the
C++ cxx::GameController (GameController.h), for the code that is not converted yet: its callers
(34 files message it by selector), the units of slices 2 and 3 of GameController.mm
(docs/phases/3-slices/GameController.md: the frame loop and deferred calls; start-up, splash and
progress messages, exit and the player file), and the FullScreen category
(SDL/GameController+SDLFullScreen.mm, bead oo-qinv; Core/GameController+FullScreen.mm, Mac-only),
which stay Objective-C methods of this façade until their own beads. Its interface is the one
GameController.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types): the
slice 1 selectors, declared by the OOObjCBridge category below, forward to their C++ members in one
line each (GameController+ObjCBridge.mm); the rest stay in the class's @interface, which
GameController.mm's @implementation implements as before (ADR-0056 amendment oo-zkpmt); the
FullScreen category is unchanged. Those methods read and write the state through the @public
_cxxController (amendment oo-bj8 item 2). Imported as the last line of GameController.h; do not
import it directly.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                       crosses with
	-------------------------------------  -----------------------------------  ------------------------
	still Objective-C                      GameController * (this façade)       nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        cxx::GameController * (the singleton)
	  handing the controller to Objective-C                                     oo::ToObjC(controller)
	  taking it from Objective-C                                                oo::ToCxx(objcController)

The controller is a singleton: +sharedController answers one façade for the life of the process
(proposed ADR-0056 amendment oo-r7m0, item 5). Never add to this file; converted code does not
message the façade. Deleted by its deletion bead once slices 2 and 3 and the FullScreen category
are converted and no file outside GameController.* names the Objective-C class.
