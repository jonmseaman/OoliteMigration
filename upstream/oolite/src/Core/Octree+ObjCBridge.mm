Octree+ObjCBridge.mm

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-novu): the Objective-C Octree facade over cxx::Octree.
Every method forwards to its C++ member: arguments that were Octree * go through oo::ToCxx,
results that were Octree * come back through oo::ToObjC. -cxx_initWithDictionary: makes and owns
the C++ octree and records the facade as its peer (ADR-0056 amendment oo-86ek), or answers nil as
before. Deleted with Octree+ObjCBridge.h.
