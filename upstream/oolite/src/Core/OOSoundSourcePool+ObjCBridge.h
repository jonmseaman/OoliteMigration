OOSoundSourcePool+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en): the Objective-C
OOSoundSourcePool, a facade over the C++ cxx::OOSoundSourcePool (OOSoundSourcePool.h), for the
player's sound category (PlayerEntitySound.mm), which makes five pools and sends them about forty
messages. Its interface is the one OOSoundSourcePool.h declared before the conversion, copied
exactly. Imported as the last line of OOSoundSourcePool.h; do not import it directly.

oo::ToObjC(oo::ToCxx(p)) == p. Never add to this file; converted code does not message the facade.
Deleted by its deletion bead once the player is C++.
