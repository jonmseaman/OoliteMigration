OOSystemDescriptionManager+FoundationBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0043, "Transitional bridges"; bead oo-868e, made by chunk oo-3rb.107 and
extended by its later chunks). OOSystemDescriptionManager's Foundation-typed API as it was before
its sweep, with the same selector names and types, forwarding to the cxx_ API in
OOSystemDescriptionManager.h. It exists so that OOSystemDescriptionManager's callers compile
unchanged; each caller moves to the cxx_ API in its own sweep bead. When `git grep` finds no caller
of anything declared here, the bridge bead deletes this file, OOSystemDescriptionManager+
FoundationBridge.mm, its line in Core/meson.build and the #import at the end of
OOSystemDescriptionManager.h. Never add to it outside the oo-868e chunks; never call it from
migrated code. oo-qps (the removal of gnustep-base) cannot compile while it exists.

Registry: src/oofnd/README.md, "Transitional bridges".
