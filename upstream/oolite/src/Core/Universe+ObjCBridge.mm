Universe+ObjCBridge.mm

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, amendment oo-riqmz): the Objective-C Universe facade (see
Universe+ObjCBridge.h). Its initialiser and -dealloc are here, in a category while the class's
@implementation is still Universe.mm, because they need the Objective-C object as self; their
bodies are cxx::Universe's initWithGameView() and dealloc(), in Universe.mm. The other methods are
still in Universe.mm until their slices move them. Deleted with Universe+ObjCBridge.h.
