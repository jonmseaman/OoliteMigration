/*	Canonical order before shuffling.

	Without this the permutation would be applied to whatever order GNUstep happened to
	produce, so the shuffled order would inherit GNUstep's - and a second implementation
	with a different hash order would shuffle differently from the same seed. Sorting by
	-description first makes the result a function of the contents alone.

	-description is used rather than -compare: because the keys of Oolite's dictionaries
	are not all strings and not everything implements -compare:. For plist-shaped data
	(which is what these dictionaries hold) -description is content-derived, so the sort is
	stable across runs. For objects whose description embeds an address it is not, and the
	shuffle degrades to "still a permutation, not reproducible" - noted rather than fixed,
	because no dictionary in the tree is keyed by such an object.
