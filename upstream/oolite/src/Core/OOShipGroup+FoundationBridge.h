OOShipGroup+FoundationBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0043, "Transitional bridges"; made by bead oo-5l4w). OOShipGroup's
Foundation-typed API as it was before its sweep, with the same selector names and types,
forwarding to the cxx_ API and OOShipGroupCursor in OOShipGroup.h. It exists so that OOShipGroup's
callers compile unchanged; each caller moves to the cxx_ API in its own sweep bead. When
`git grep` finds no caller of anything declared here, the bridge bead deletes this file,
OOShipGroup+FoundationBridge.mm, its line in Core/meson.build and the #import at the end of
OOShipGroup.h. Never add to it; never call it from migrated code. oo-qps (the removal of
gnustep-base) cannot compile while it exists.

Registry: src/oofnd/README.md, "Transitional bridges".
