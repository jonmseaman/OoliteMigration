OODrawable.h

Abstract base class for objects which can draw themselves.

C++20 since bead oo-smy, with OOMaterial the Materials module exemplar (proposed ADR-0056,
amendment oo-smy). The class is cxx::OODrawable while OODrawable+ObjCBridge.h, imported at the end
of this header, keeps the Objective-C OODrawable that its callers message and its unconverted
subclasses (OOMesh, OOPlanetDrawable, OOSkyDrawable) derive from; the bridge's deletion bead moves
it out of namespace cxx.
