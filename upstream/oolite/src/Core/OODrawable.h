OODrawable.h

Abstract base class for objects which can draw themselves.

C++20 since bead oo-smy, with OOMaterial the Materials module exemplar (proposed ADR-0056,
amendment oo-smy). Global since bead oo-9ht.9 deleted the Objective-C facade (with oo-hahfg, which
moved the entities' drawable to C++, and oo-9ht.132, the OOMesh facade): every drawable
(OOMesh, OOPlanetDrawable, OOSkyDrawable) and every holder is C++.
