OORoleSet+ObjCBridge.h

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, bead oo-bhb9): the Objective-C OORoleSet, a facade over the C++
cxx::OORoleSet (OORoleSet.h), for callers that are not converted yet. Its interface is the one
OORoleSet.h declared before the conversion, copied exactly (same selectors, same types), so those
callers compile and behave unchanged; each method forwards to its C++ member. Imported as the
last line of OORoleSet.h; do not import it directly.

	a caller that is                       holds / passes                  crosses with
	-------------------------------------  ------------------------------  ----------------------------
	still Objective-C                      OORoleSet * (this facade)       nothing: messages as before
	converted (C++)                        oo::Ref<cxx::OORoleSet>, cxx::OORoleSet *
	  handing a role set to Objective-C                                     oo::ToObjC(roleSet)
	  taking one from Objective-C                                           oo::ToCxx(objcRoleSet)

oo::ToObjC gives the set's one live facade (oo::ObjCPeers), so identity survives a round trip:
oo::ToObjC(oo::ToCxx(s)) == s. -initWithRoleString: and -initWithRole:probability: (ShipEntity
sends alloc/init) make the C++ set and record the new facade as its peer. Never add to this file;
converted code does not message the facade. Deleted by its deletion bead once no file outside
OORoleSet.* names the Objective-C OORoleSet.
