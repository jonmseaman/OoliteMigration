OORegExpMatcher.h

Regular expression utility built on top of JavaScript regexp objects in lieu
of Objective-C regexp support. Not thread-safe.

If we had a performance-critical need for regexps, I'd want a real library,
but this will do for light usage.

C++20 since bead oo-ct7c (proposed ADR-0056). Its Objective-C facade was deleted by bead
oo-9ht.12 (ADR-0056 amendment "deleting a facade"): the class is global, and a caller that wants
one matcher across several matches holds the Ref (amendment oo-ct7c item 3).
