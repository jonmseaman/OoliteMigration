OOSoundSourcePool+ObjCBridge.mm

TRANSITIONAL (proposed ADR-0056, the Audio module: amendment oo-2en): the Objective-C
OOSoundSourcePool facade (see OOSoundSourcePool+ObjCBridge.h). Every method forwards to its C++
member, with the overload its selector names. Deleted with OOSoundSourcePool+ObjCBridge.h.
